# Resolve Addressed PR Review Comments

Resolve review comments that have been **clearly addressed** in the code.

## Important

- Check each comment individually
- Only resolve if the specific fix is confirmed in the code
- Do NOT resolve comments that are unclear or still pending

## Steps

1. Get unresolved thread IDs from the PR
2. For each comment, verify the fix exists in the code
3. Resolve only confirmed threads using `resolveReviewThread` mutation

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation {
  resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: "PRRT_xxx"}) {
    thread { isResolved }
  }
}'
```

# Repomix Release Note Writing Guidelines

Based on analysis of existing release notes in `.github/releases/`, this document outlines the patterns, style, and format for writing consistent Repomix release notes.

## Reference Material

**Important**: The `.github/releases/` directory contains the actual GitHub release notes used for all past releases. Always reference these files when writing new release notes to maintain consistency with the established patterns, tone, and format. The release notes are organized by version (v0.1.x, v0.2.x, v0.3.x, v1.x) and provide concrete examples of how different types of features and improvements should be presented.

## Overall Structure and Format

### Header Pattern
- Start with a compelling one-line summary that captures the main theme
- Use action words and highlight key benefits for AI analysis/user experience
- End with an exclamation mark for enthusiasm

**Examples:**
- "This release introduces git commit history integration and enhanced binary file detection, making Repomix more informative for AI analysis and user visibility!"
- "This release brings token optimization and MCP Structured Output support, making Repomix more efficient and reliable for AI integration!"
- "This release brings **Bun runtime support** to Repomix!"

## Section Structure

### Required Sections

#### 1. What's New 🚀
- Always the first section
- Use `###` for feature subsections
- Include PR numbers in parentheses: `(#793)`
- Lead with the most significant features first

#### 2. How to Update
- Always the final section before footer
- Use standard npm update command:
  ```bash
  npm update -g repomix
  ```
- Include alternative package managers when relevant (Bun, etc.)

#### 3. Footer
- Consistent closing message:
  ```
  ---
  
  As always, if you have any issues or suggestions, please let us know on GitHub issues or our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/wNYzTwZFku).
  ```

### Optional Sections (Use When Relevant)

#### Improvements ⚡
- For enhancements to existing features
- Less significant than "What's New" items

#### Internal Changes 🔧
- **Generally avoid including this section** - internal changes are typically not relevant to users
- Only include if the internal change has direct user-visible benefits or impacts
- For infrastructure, CI/CD, or internal improvements that don't affect user experience, omit entirely

#### Website Enhancements 🌐
- For Repomix website updates

#### Documentation 📚
- For documentation improvements

## Writing Style and Tone

### Language Characteristics
- **Enthusiastic but professional**: Use exclamation marks, emojis, but maintain clarity
- **User-focused**: Emphasize benefits for AI analysis, development workflows, and user experience
- **Technical precision**: Include exact commands, configuration examples, and technical details
- **Concise explanations**: Get to the point quickly, expand with examples when helpful

### Key Phrases and Patterns
- "This release introduces/brings..."
- "Added the powerful `--option-name` option..."
- "Now supports..." 
- "Special thanks to @username for..."
- "making it easier to..." / "making Repomix more..."

## Content Guidelines

### Feature Descriptions
1. **Lead with the benefit**: Start with what the user gains
2. **Include technical details**: Show command examples and configuration options
3. **Provide context**: Explain why the feature matters
4. **Credit contributors**: Always acknowledge PR authors

### Code Examples
- Always use proper markdown code blocks with language specification
- Include both CLI usage and configuration file examples when applicable
- Show realistic examples, not just syntax

**Example Pattern:**
```bash
# Enable the option
repomix --option-name

# Enable in config file
{
  "output": {
    "optionName": true
  }
}
```

### PR References and Credits
- Include PR numbers for all features: `### Feature Name (#123)`
- Credit contributors: `Special thanks to @username for this contribution! 🎉`
- For first-time contributors, mention it: `Special thanks to @BBboy01 for their first contribution...`

## Specific Writing Patterns

### Feature Naming
- Use descriptive, benefit-focused titles
- Include technical terms when they add clarity
- **Examples:**
  - "Git Commit History Integration" (not just "Git Integration")
  - "Automatic Base64 Data Truncation for Token Savings" (emphasizes the benefit)
  - "Token Count Summarization" (clear and specific)

### Technical Explanations
- Start with the high-level benefit
- Follow with technical implementation details
- Include practical examples
- End with configuration options

### Version-Specific Patterns
- **Major features**: Get their own subsection with detailed explanation
- **Minor improvements**: Can be listed as bullet points
- **Breaking changes**: Should be highlighted prominently (though rare in recent releases)

## Quality Checklist

Before publishing, verify:

- [ ] Header captures the release theme with enthusiasm
- [ ] All features include PR references
- [ ] Contributors are credited appropriately  
- [ ] Code examples are properly formatted and realistic
- [ ] Benefits for AI analysis/user workflows are clearly stated
- [ ] Commands can be copy-pasted and work as shown
- [ ] Consistent emoji usage across sections
- [ ] Footer message is identical to previous releases
- [ ] Links to Discord and GitHub are correct

## Verification Commands

When writing release notes, use these commands to verify content accuracy:

```bash
# Verify issue content
gh issue view <issue-number>

# Verify PR content  
gh pr view <pr-number>

# Check contributor information
gh pr view <pr-number> --json author
```

This ensures accurate descriptions and proper attribution in release notes.

# Repomix Project Structure and Overview

This document provides a structural overview of the Repomix project, designed to aid AI code assistants (like Copilot) in understanding the codebase.

Please refer to `README.md` for a complete and up-to-date project overview, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` for implementation guidelines and contribution procedures.

## Project Overview

Repomix is a tool that packs the contents of a software repository into a single file, making it easier for AI systems to analyze and process the codebase. It supports various output formats (XML, Markdown, or plain text), ignores files based on configurable patterns, and performs security checks to exclude potentially sensitive information.

## Directory Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

```
repomix/
├── browser/ # Browser extension source code.
├── src/ # Main source code
│   ├── cli/ # Command-line interface logic (argument parsing, command handling, output)
│   ├── config/ # Configuration loading, schema, and defaults
│   ├── core/ # Core logic of Repomix
│   │   ├── file/ # File handling (reading, processing, searching, tree structure generation, git commands)

---
description: Pack local codebase with Repomix
---

Pack a local codebase using Repomix with AI-optimized format.

When the user asks to pack a local codebase, analyze their request and run the appropriate repomix command.

## User Intent Examples

The user might ask in various ways:
- "Pack this codebase"
- "Pack the src directory"
- "Pack this project as markdown"
- "Pack TypeScript files only"
- "Pack with compression and copy to clipboard"
- "Pack this project including git history"

## Your Responsibilities

1. **Understand the user's intent** from natural language
2. **Determine the appropriate options**:
   - Which directory to pack (default: current directory)
   - Output format: xml (default), markdown, json, or plain
   - Whether to compress (for large codebases)
   - File patterns to include/ignore
   - Additional features (copy to clipboard, include git diffs/logs)
3. **Execute the command** with: `npx repomix@latest [directory] [options]`

## Available Options

- `--style <format>`: Output format (xml, markdown, json, plain)
- `--include <patterns>`: Include only matching patterns (e.g., "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md")
- `--ignore <patterns>`: Additional ignore patterns
- `--compress`: Enable Tree-sitter compression (~70% token reduction)
- `--output <path>`: Custom output path
- `--copy`: Copy output to clipboard
- `--include-diffs`: Include git diff output
- `--include-logs`: Include git commit history

## Command Examples

Based on user intent, you might run:

```bash
# "Pack this codebase"
npx repomix@latest

# "Pack the src directory"
npx repomix@latest src/

# "Pack as markdown with compression"
npx repomix@latest --style markdown --compress

# "Pack only TypeScript and Markdown files"
npx repomix@latest --include "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md"

# "Pack and copy to clipboard"
npx repomix@latest --copy

# "Pack with git history"
npx repomix@latest --include-diffs --include-logs
```

## Analyzing the Output

**IMPORTANT**: The generated output file can be very large and consume significant context.

If the user wants to analyze or explore the generated output:
- **DO NOT read the entire output file directly**
- **USE an appropriate sub-agent** to analyze the output
- The sub-agent will efficiently search and read specific sections using grep and incremental reading

**Agent Selection Strategy**:
1. If `repomix-explorer:explorer` agent is available, use it (optimized for repomix output analysis)
2. Otherwise, use the `general-purpose` agent or another suitable sub-agent
3. The sub-agent should use Grep and Read tools to analyze incrementally

Example:
```text
User: "Pack this codebase and analyze it"

Your workflow:
1. Run: npx repomix@latest
2. Note the output file location (e.g., repomix-output.xml)
3. Launch an appropriate sub-agent with task:
   "Analyze the repomix output file at ./repomix-output.xml.
   Use Grep tool to search for patterns and Read tool to examine specific sections.
   Provide an overview of the codebase structure and main components.
   Do NOT read the entire file at once."
```

## Help and Documentation

If you need more information about available options or encounter any issues:
- Run `npx repomix@latest -h` or `npx repomix@latest --help` to see all available options
- Check the official documentation at https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix

Remember: Parse the user's natural language request and translate it into the appropriate repomix command. For analysis tasks, delegate to appropriate sub-agents to avoid consuming excessive context.

You are an expert code analyst specializing in repository exploration using Repomix CLI. Your role is to help users understand codebases by running repomix commands, then reading and analyzing the generated output files.

## User Intent Examples

The user might ask in various ways:

### Remote Repository Analysis
- "Analyze the yamadashy/repomix repository"
- "What's the structure of facebook/react?"
- "Explore https://github.com/microsoft/vscode"
- "Find all TypeScript files in the Next.js repo"
- "Show me the main components of vercel/next.js"

### Local Repository Analysis
- "Analyze this codebase"
- "Explore the ./src directory"
- "What's in this project?"
- "Find all configuration files in the current directory"
- "Show me the structure of ~/projects/my-app"

### Pattern Discovery
- "Find all authentication-related code"
- "Show me all React components"
- "Where are the API endpoints defined?"
- "Find all database models"
- "Show me error handling code"

### Metrics and Statistics
- "How many files are in this project?"
- "What's the token count?"
- "Show me the largest files"
- "How much TypeScript vs JavaScript?"

## Your Responsibilities

1. **Understand the user's intent** from natural language
2. **Determine the appropriate repomix command**:
   - Remote repository: `npx repomix@latest --remote <repo>`
   - Local directory: `npx repomix@latest [directory]`
   - Choose output format (xml is default and recommended)
   - Decide if compression is needed (for repos >100k lines)
3. **Execute the repomix command** via Bash tool
4. **Analyze the generated output** using Grep and Read tools
5. **Provide clear insights** with actionable recommendations

## Available Tools

### Bash Tool
Run repomix commands and shell utilities:
```bash
npx repomix@latest --remote yamadashy/repomix
npx repomix@latest ./src
grep -i "pattern" repomix-output.xml
```

### Grep Tool
Search patterns in output files (preferred over bash grep):
- Use for finding code patterns, functions, imports
- Supports context lines (-A, -B, -C equivalents)
- More efficient than bash grep for large files

### Read Tool
Read specific sections of output files:
- Use offset/limit for large files
- Read file tree section first for structure overview
- Read specific file contents as needed

## Workflow

### Step 1: Pack the Repository

**For Remote Repositories:**
```bash
npx repomix@latest --remote <repo> [options]
```

**For Local Directories:**
```bash
npx repomix@latest [directory] [options]
```

**Common Options:**
- `--style <format>`: Output format (xml, markdown, json, plain) - **xml is default and recommended**
- `--compress`: Enable Tree-sitter compression (~70% token reduction) - use for large repos
- `--include <patterns>`: Include only matching patterns (e.g., "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md")
- `--ignore <patterns>`: Additional ignore patterns
- `--output <path>`: Custom output path (default: repomix-output.xml)

**Command Examples:**
```bash
# Basic remote pack
npx repomix@latest --remote yamadashy/repomix

# Basic local pack
npx repomix@latest

# Pack specific directory
npx repomix@latest ./src

# Large repo with compression
npx repomix@latest --remote facebook/react --compress

# Include only specific file types
npx repomix@latest --include "**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}"

# Custom output location
npx repomix@latest --remote user/repo --output analysis.xml
```

### Step 2: Check Command Output

The repomix command will display:
- **Files processed**: Number of files included
- **Total characters**: Size of content
- **Total tokens**: Estimated AI tokens
- **Output file location**: Where the file was saved (default: `./repomix-output.xml`)

Always note the output file location for the next steps.

### Step 3: Analyze the Output File

**Start with structure overview:**
1. Use Grep or Read tool to view file tree (usually near the beginning)
2. Check metrics summary for overall statistics

**Search for patterns:**
```bash
# Using Grep tool (preferred)
grep -iE "export.*function|export.*class" repomix-output.xml

# Using bash grep with context
grep -iE -A 5 -B 5 "authentication|auth" repomix-output.xml
```

**Read specific sections:**
Use Read tool with offset/limit for large files, or read entire file if small.

### Step 4: Provide Insights

- **Report metrics**: Files, tokens, size from command output
- **Describe structure**: From file tree analysis
- **Highlight findings**: Based on grep results
- **Suggest next steps**: Areas to explore further

## Best Practices

### Efficiency
1. **Always use `--compress` for large repos** (>100k lines)
2. **Use Grep tool first** before reading entire files
3. **Use custom output paths** when analyzing multiple repos to avoid overwriting
4. **Clean up output files** after analysis if they're very large

### Output Format
- **XML (default)**: Best for structured analysis, clear file boundaries
- **Plain**: Simpler to grep, but less structured
- **Markdown**: Human-readable, good for documentation
- **JSON**: Machine-readable, good for programmatic analysis

**Recommendation**: Stick with XML unless user requests otherwise.

### Search Patterns
Common useful patterns:
```bash
# Functions and classes
grep -iE "export.*function|export.*class|function |class " file.xml

# Imports and dependencies
grep -iE "import.*from|require\(" file.xml

# Configuration
grep -iE "config|Config|configuration" file.xml

# Authentication/Authorization
grep -iE "auth|login|password|token|jwt" file.xml

# API endpoints
grep -iE "router|route|endpoint|api" file.xml

# Database/Models
grep -iE "model|schema|database|query" file.xml

# Error handling
grep -iE "error|Error|exception|try.*catch" file.xml
```

### File Management
- Default output: `./repomix-output.xml` or `./repomix-output.txt`
- Use `--output` flag for custom paths
- Clean up large files after analysis: `rm repomix-output.xml`
- Or keep for future reference if space allows

## Communication Style

- **Be concise but comprehensive**: Summarize findings clearly
- **Use clear technical language**: Code, file paths, commands should be precise
- **Cite sources**: Reference file paths and line numbers
- **Suggest next steps**: Guide further exploration

## Example Workflows

### Example 1: Basic Remote Repository Analysis
```
User: "Analyze the yamadashy/repomix repository"

Your workflow:
1. Run: npx repomix@latest --remote yamadashy/repomix
2. Note the metrics from command output (files, tokens)
3. Grep: grep -i "export" repomix-output.xml (find main exports)
4. Read file tree section to understand structure
5. Summarize:
   "This repository contains [number] files.
   Main components include: [list].
   Total tokens: approximately [number]."
```

### Example 2: Finding Specific Patterns
```
User: "Find authentication code in this repository"

Your workflow:
1. Run: npx repomix@latest (or --remote if specified)
2. Grep: grep -iE -A 5 -B 5 "auth|authentication|login|password" repomix-output.xml
3. Analyze matches and categorize by file
4. Use Read tool to get more context if needed
5. Report:
   "Authentication-related code found in the following files:
   - [file1]: [description]
   - [file2]: [description]"
```

### Example 3: Structure Analysis
```
User: "Explain the structure of this project"

Your workflow:
1. Run: npx repomix@latest ./
2. Read file tree from output (use Read tool with limit if needed)
3. Grep for main entry points: grep -iE "index|main|app" repomix-output.xml
4. Grep for exports: grep "export" repomix-output.xml | head -20
5. Provide structural overview with ASCII diagram if helpful
```

### Example 4: Large Repository with Compression
```
User: "Analyze facebook/react - it's a large repository"

Your workflow:
1. Run: npx repomix@latest --remote facebook/react --compress
2. Note compression reduced token count (~70% reduction)
3. Check metrics and file tree
4. Grep for main components
5. Report findings with note about compression used
```

### Example 5: Specific File Types Only
```
User: "I want to see only TypeScript files"

Your workflow:
1. Run: npx repomix@latest --include "**/*.{ts,tsx}"
2. Analyze TypeScript-specific patterns
3. Report findings focused on TS code
```

## Error Handling

If you encounter issues:

1. **Command fails**:
   - Check error message
   - Verify repository URL/path
   - Check permissions
   - Suggest appropriate solutions

2. **Large output file**:
   - Use `--compress` flag
   - Use `--include` to narrow scope
   - Read file in chunks with offset/limit

3. **Pattern not found**:
   - Try alternative patterns
   - Check file tree to verify files exist
   - Suggest broader search

4. **Network issues** (for remote):
   - Verify connection
   - Try again
   - Suggest using local clone instead

## Help and Documentation

If you need more information:
- Run `npx repomix@latest --help` to see all available options
- Check the official documentation at https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix
- Repomix automatically excludes sensitive files based on security checks

## Important Notes

1. **Don't use MCP tools**: This agent uses repomix CLI commands directly via Bash tool
2. **Output file management**: Track where files are created, clean up if needed
3. **Token efficiency**: Use `--compress` for large repos to reduce token usage
4. **Incremental analysis**: Don't read entire files at once; use grep first
5. **Security**: Repomix automatically excludes sensitive files; trust its security checks

## Self-Verification Checklist

Before completing your analysis:

- ✓ Did you run the repomix command successfully?
- ✓ Did you note the metrics from command output?
- ✓ Did you use Grep tool efficiently before reading large sections?
- ✓ Are your insights based on actual data from the output?
- ✓ Have you provided file paths and line numbers for references?
- ✓ Did you suggest logical next steps for deeper exploration?
- ✓ Did you communicate clearly and concisely?
- ✓ Did you note the output file location for user reference?
- ✓ Did you clean up or mention cleanup if output file is very large?

Remember: Your goal is to make repository exploration intelligent and efficient. Run repomix strategically, search before reading, and provide actionable insights based on real code analysis.

/explore-local . - find all authentication-related code
```

## What to Tell the Agent

Provide the repomix-explorer:explorer agent with a task that includes:
- The directory path to analyze (absolute path)
- Any specific focus areas mentioned by the user
- Clear instructions about what analysis is needed

Default instruction template:
```
"Analyze this local directory: [absolute_path]

Task: Provide an overview of the codebase structure, main components, and key patterns.

Steps:
1. Run `npx repomix@latest [path]` to pack the codebase
2. Note the output file location
3. Use Grep and Read tools to analyze the output incrementally
4. Report your findings

[Add any specific focus areas if mentioned by user]
"
```

## Command Flow

1. Parse the directory path from user input (default to current directory if not specified)
2. Resolve to absolute path
3. Identify any specific questions or focus areas from the user's request
4. Launch the repomix-explorer:explorer agent with:

# Browser Extension Developer

Cross-browser extension (Chrome/Firefox/Edge) using **WXT framework** with Manifest V3. Injects "Repomix" button into GitHub repository pages.

## Structure

```plaintext
browser/
├── entrypoints/       # background.ts, content.ts
├── public/_locales/   # i18n (12 languages)
├── wxt.config.ts      # WXT configuration
└── .output/           # Built files (chrome-mv3, firefox-mv2)

name: lint-fixer
description: "Use this skill to run npm run lint and fix linting issues. Triggers on fixing lint errors after code changes or validating code against project style guidelines."
---

# Lint Fixer

Fix linting issues while preserving code functionality.

## Lint Tools

`npm run lint` runs 4 tools in sequence:

1. **Biome** (`biome check --write`) - Formatter + linter, auto-fixes
2. **oxlint** (`oxlint --fix`) - Fast JS/TS linter, auto-fixes
3. **tsgo** (`tsgo --noEmit`) - TypeScript type checking
4. **secretlint** - Detects secrets/credentials

## Workflow

1. Run `npm run lint` to identify issues
2. Review errors by category (type errors vs style vs secrets)
3. Fix issues - Biome/oxlint auto-fix most style issues
4. Run `npm run lint` again to verify
5. Run `npm run test` to ensure no breakage

## Config Files

- `biome.json` - Formatting rules (2 spaces, 120 chars, single quotes)
- `.oxlintrc.json` - JS/TS lint rules
- `.secretlintrc.json` - Secret detection rules

## Key Points

- Biome/oxlint auto-fix most issues; review changes
- Type errors (tsgo) require manual fixes
- Never change code behavior when fixing lint
- Keep files under 250 lines

name: website-maintainer
description: Use this skill when working on the Repomix documentation website in `website/` directory, including VitePress configuration, multi-language content, or translation workflows.
---

# Website Maintainer

VitePress documentation site with 14 languages.

## Structure

```plaintext
website/client/
├── .vitepress/
│   ├── config.ts           # Main config (imports all locales)
│   └── config/
│       ├── configShard.ts  # Shared settings (PWA, sitemap, etc.)
│       └── config[Lang].ts # Per-language config (nav, sidebar, search)
└── src/
    └── [lang]/             # en, ja, zh-cn, zh-tw, ko, de, fr, es, pt-br, id, vi, hi, it, ru
```

## Adding New Language

1. Create `config/configXx.ts` based on existing (exports config + search translations)
2. Import and add to `locales` in `config.ts`
3. Add search config to `configShard.ts`
4. Create `src/xx/` directory with content (copy from `en/`)

## Editing Content

- **Documents**: Edit `src/[lang]/guide/*.md` (e.g., `src/ja/guide/installation.md`)
- **Navigation/Sidebar**: Edit `config/config[Lang].ts` → `themeConfig.sidebar`
- **Shared settings** (logo, footer): Edit `configShard.ts`

## Translation Guidelines

- English (`src/en/`) is source of truth
- Keep code examples and CLI options unchanged
- Translate UI labels in config file (nav, sidebar, search modal)

`````markdown
It appears I've been fashionably late to the release notes soirée.  It's like we've been living under a rock from v0.1.1 to v0.1.14. But they, better late than never, as they say in the world of procrastinating developers.

## New Features

### Output Style Options
- Introducing the `output.style` configuration option:
  - `plain`: The classic output format.
  - `xml`: An XML-structured output for enhanced parsing.

This addition aims to provide more flexibility in how Repopack structures its output.

For those interested in the potential of XML tags in AI contexts:
https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/use-xml-tags

## How to Use

Add `output.style` to your configuration and select either `plain` or `xml`. The choice is yours, based on your project needs.

---
Your feedback is the wind beneath Repopack's wings. Feel free to report bugs or request features.

Thank you for your continued support.
`````

## File: .github/releases/v0.1.x/v0.1.16.md
`````markdown
Our CLI has learned the art of style. It's now fluent in both plain and XML.

## What's New

- Added `--style` option to CLI
  - Choose between `plain` and `xml` output styles
  - Usage: `repopack --style xml`

Happy packing!

## File: .github/releases/v0.1.x/v0.1.18.md
`````markdown
It's focusing on security improvements and output refinements. 

## Improvements
###  Security Enhancements: Exclude Suspicious Files
- Implemented a filter to exclude potentially sensitive files from the output. 
- This improvement prevents the inclusion of suspicious files, enhancing overall security.

## Fixes
### Prevent Recursive Output Issues
- Modified the `getFilePaths` function in `src/core/packager.ts` to exclude the output file from processing.
- This fix resolves a recursive issue where the output file was being included in itself.

## Changes
### XML Escaping Removal
- Removed XML escaping for file paths and contents in repository files.
- This change improves readability and AI comprehension of the generated output.

Note: This update assumes that input data (file paths, contents, etc.) does not contain characters that would break XML syntax. If there's a possibility of such characters, we may implement a more robust solution in the future, such as using CDATA sections for file contents.
`````

## File: .github/releases/v0.1.x/v0.1.19.md
`````markdown
It's focusing on improved file filtering capabilities and overall performance enhancements. 

## New Features

### Support `include` (#22, #30)
- Introduced the `--include` CLI option for specifying files to include using glob patterns. 
- Added support for `include` patterns in the configuration file.

To pack specific files or directories using glob patterns:
```bash
repopack --include "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md"
```

Special thanks to @IsaacSante for their contributions.

## Improvements

### Performance Optimization
- Replaced the `ignore` package with `globby` for more efficient file filtering.
`````

## File: .github/releases/v0.1.x/v0.1.20.md
`````markdown
## Changes

### gitignore Syntax Compliance
- Fixed handling of `.gitignore` and `.repopackignore` files to properly comply with gitignore syntax.
- This ensures more accurate and consistent file filtering based on your ignore patterns.

### Change File Filtering Logic
- Migrated custom ignore pattern processing from gitignore syntax to glob patterns. 

## Notes

- This update may affect which files are included/excluded in the packed output. We recommend reviewing your ignore patterns to ensure desired behavior.
- If you're using a custom configuration, make sure to update your `ignore.customPatterns` to use glob patterns instead of gitignore syntax.
`````

## File: .github/releases/v0.1.x/v0.1.21.md
`````markdown
## Improvements

### Enhanced ignore files support (#34, #35)
- Updated the file filtering logic to consider `.gitignore`, `.repopackignore` files in all directories, not just the root.
- This change ensures that all ignore files, regardless of their location in the project structure, are properly respected during the file filtering process.

## Notes
- This update improves the handling of ignore files in your project structure. You may notice changes in which files are included or excluded if you have ignore files in subdirectories.

### Example
Using compression via CLI:
```bash
repomix --compress
```

Before:
```typescript
import { ShoppingItem } from './shopping-item';

/**
 * Calculate the total price of shopping items
 */
const calculateTotal = (
  items: ShoppingItem[]
) => {
  let total = 0;
  for (const item of items) {
    total += item.price * item.quantity;
  }
  return total;
}

// Shopping item interface
interface Item {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  quantity: number;
}
```

After compression:
```typescript
import { ShoppingItem } from './shopping-item';
⋮----
/**
 * Calculate the total price of shopping items
 */

## What's New 🚀

### Claude Agent Skills Generation (#952, #998)

Added a new `--skill-generate` option that creates structured [Agent Skills](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) packages for Claude Code. Skills are pre-packaged code references that help Claude understand and work with specific projects more effectively.

```bash
# Generate a skill from your codebase
repomix --skill-generate

# From remote repository with custom name
repomix --remote facebook/react --skill-generate react-reference

# Documentation-only skill
repomix --remote anthropics/claude-code-action --include "docs/**" --skill-generate
```

This is particularly useful for referencing implementations from open source projects—generate a skill from any repository, and Claude can reference those patterns while working on your code.

**Key Features:**

- **Interactive Location Selection**: Choose between Project Skills (`.claude/skills/`) for team sharing or Personal Skills (`~/.claude/skills/`) for individual use
- **Auto-naming**: Automatically generates skill names as `repomix-reference-<folder-name>`
- **Multi-file Output Structure**:
  - `SKILL.md` - Entry point with usage guide
  - `references/summary.md` - Purpose, format, and statistics
  - `references/project-structure.md` - Directory tree with line counts
  - `references/files.md` - All file contents
  - `references/tech-stack.md` - Languages, frameworks, and dependencies
- **Tech Stack Detection**: Automatically detects languages, frameworks, dependencies, runtime versions (`.node-version`, `.tool-versions`), and configuration files
- **MCP Tool Support**: New `generate_skill` MCP tool for programmatic skill generation

Learn more in the [Agent Skills Generation documentation](https://repomix.com/guide/agent-skills-generation).

This release improves skill generation for remote repositories, making the `--skill-generate --remote` workflow more reliable and informative!

## Bug Fixes 🐛

### Fixed Project Name Generation for Remote Repositories (#1001)

Previously, the project name was incorrectly derived from the temp directory name (e.g., "Repomix HPkbgH"). Now it correctly extracts the repository name from the URL.

```bash
repomix --remote https://github.com/vitejs/vite --skill-generate
# Before: SKILL.md title was "Reference codebase for Repomix HPkbgH"
# After: SKILL.md title is "Reference codebase for Vite" ✨
```

### Fixed `.claude/` Directory Conflicts (#1001)

When the remote repository has its own `.claude/` directory (with commands, agents, etc.), only `.claude/skills/` is now copied to prevent conflicts with your existing configuration.

## Improvements ⚡

### Source URL in SKILL.md (#1001)

For remote repositories, the SKILL.md footer now includes the source URL for easy reference:
- Remote: `This skill was generated by Repomix from https://github.com/vitejs/vite`
- Local: No URL included (to avoid exposing personal paths)

This release fixes critical Go code processing issues and improves binary file reporting for better user experience!

## Bug Fixes 🐛

### Fix Go Code `--remove-comments` Processing (#814)
Fixed a critical hang issue when processing Go files containing backtick raw string literals in function calls. This specific pattern in Go syntax wasn't being handled correctly by our comment removal logic, causing infinite loops.

This made Repomix completely unusable for a few Go projects, as the process would hang indefinitely.

**Problematic pattern that caused hangs:**
```go
func example() {
    fmt.Fprintln(out, heredoc.Doc(`
        Multi-line raw string content
    `))
}
```

### Binary File Detection Reporting (#815)

```bash
# Generate JSON output
repomix --style json

# Via configuration file
{
  "output": {
    "style": "json"
  }
}
```

The JSON format provides a clean structure:
```json5
{
  "fileSummary": { /* metadata and usage guidelines */ },
  "directoryStructure": "src/\n  cli/\n    ...",
  "files": {
    "src/index.js": "// File contents here"
  }
}
```

Perfect for programmatic processing with `jq`:
```bash
# Extract file list
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[]'

# Get specific file content
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files["src/index.js"]'
```

This JSON format is particularly easy to handle with `jq`, enabling AI agents to efficiently extract specific parts without processing the entire output.

For detailed JSON format documentation and more examples, see: https://repomix.com/guide/output#json-format

## Improvements ⚡

## File: .github/releases/v1.x/v1.6.1.md
`````markdown
This release fixes a critical bug with the `--stdin` option and includes dependency updates and website improvements.

## Bug Fixes 🐛

### Fixed `--stdin` Option Hang in v1.6.0 (#867, #878)
Resolved a critical issue where the `--stdin` option would hang when piping file paths to Repomix.

The problem occurred because v1.6.0 moved the entire CLI processing to child_process workers for better resource isolation, but child_process workers don't inherit stdin from the parent process by default. This caused commands like `git ls-files | repomix --stdin` to hang indefinitely.

**The fix:** Stdin processing now happens in the main process before passing file paths to the worker.

This ensures that stdin-based workflows work correctly while preserving the stability improvements introduced in v1.6.0.

## Improvements ⚡

### Website Enhancements (#864, #865)
- Added cancel functionality for pack requests, allowing users to stop long-running operations

### CI/CD Improvements (#866)
- Replaced ratchet with pinact for GitHub Actions SHA pinning

## How to Update

```bash
npm update -g repomix
```

## File: .github/releases/v1.x/v1.7.0.md
`````markdown
This release introduces TypeScript/JavaScript config support and Azure DevOps integration, making Repomix more flexible and compatible with enterprise development environments!

## What's New 🚀

### TypeScript/JavaScript Config File Support (#870, #886)
Added support for TypeScript and JavaScript configuration files with a `defineConfig` helper function for better developer experience, similar to Vite and ESLint.

This provides a more flexible alternative to static JSON configurations, allowing you to implement any dynamic configuration you need.

```typescript
// repomix.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'repomix';

const today = new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 10);

export default defineConfig({
  output: {
    filePath: `repomix-output-${today}.xml`,
    style: 'xml',
  },
});
```

**Benefits:**
- Full TypeScript type checking in config files
- Excellent IDE autocomplete and IntelliSense
- Dynamic configuration based on environment (timestamps, environment variables, etc.)

**Priority Order:**
1. **TypeScript** (`repomix.config.ts`, `repomix.config.mts`, `repomix.config.cts`)
2. **JavaScript/ES Module** (`repomix.config.js`, `repomix.config.mjs`, `repomix.config.cjs`)
3. **JSON** (`repomix.config.json5`, `repomix.config.jsonc`, `repomix.config.json`)

### Azure DevOps Remote Repository Support (#848, #881)
Added support for Azure DevOps remote repository URLs, making Repomix compatible with enterprise environments using Azure DevOps.

Azure DevOps uses special URL formats:
- SSH: `git@ssh.dev.azure.com:v3/org/project/repo`
- HTTPS: `https://dev.azure.com/organization/project/_git/repo`

Repomix now correctly parses and processes these URLs when packing remote repositories.

## Bug Fixes 🐛

### Binary Files Now Visible in Directory Structure (#841, #883)
Fixed a regression where binary files were not appearing in the directory structure section of the output, despite the documentation stating they should be included.

This regression was introduced in v0.1.18 (August 2024) when implementing the security check feature. Binary files are now correctly included in the directory structure while remaining properly excluded from the file contents section.

### Remote Repository Output Path Handling (#873, #885)
Fixed an error that occurred when using the remote repository feature with an absolute path specified for the output file. The tool now correctly handles cases where source and target paths resolve to the same location, preventing unnecessary file copy operations.

## How to Update

```bash
npm update -g repomix
```

`````markdown
This release introduces official Claude Code plugins and enhanced directory visibility, making Repomix more powerful for AI-powered development workflows and project exploration!

## What's New 🚀

### Repomix Claude Code Plugins (#893)
Added official Repomix plugins for Claude Code, enabling seamless AI-powered codebase analysis directly within your Claude Code environment!

**Two complementary plugins:**
- **repomix-mcp**: MCP server integration providing tools for packing, searching, and reading codebases
- **repomix-commands**: Natural language slash commands (`/pack-local`, `/pack-remote`) for quick operations

Learn more in the [Claude Code Plugins documentation](https://repomix.com/guide/claude-code-plugins).

### Full Directory Structure Display (#896)
Added the `--include-full-directory-structure` option to display the complete repository directory tree when using `--include` patterns!

```bash
repomix --include "cli/**/*.go" --include-full-directory-structure
```

This shows the full project structure while maintaining focused file selection, providing better context for AI analysis.

Special thanks to @slavakurilyak for their contribution! 🎉

### Dart Language Support for Tree-sitter Compression (#889)
Added Dart language support to tree-sitter compression, enabling ~50% token reduction for Dart and Flutter projects!

## Bug Fixes 🐛

- Fixed Claude Code plugin marketplace schema validation (#898, #900, #901)

Special thanks to @ramarivera for their contribution! 🎉

## How to Update

```bash
npm update -g repomix
```

## File: .github/releases/v1.x/v1.9.0.md
`````markdown
This release introduces the Repomix Explorer plugin for advanced AI-powered codebase analysis and .ignore file support, making Repomix more flexible and powerful for development workflows!

## What's New 🚀

### `.ignore` File Support (#937, #938)
Added support for `.ignore` files, which are used by tools like ripgrep and the silver searcher! This allows you to maintain a single `.ignore` file that works across multiple tools.

```bash
# Enable .ignore file support (enabled by default)
repomix

# Disable .ignore file support
repomix --no-dot-ignore

# Configure in repomix.config.json
{
  "ignore": {
    "useDotIgnore": false
  }
}
```

**Ignore file priority order:**
1. Custom patterns
2. `.repomixignore`
3. **`.ignore`** (new!)
4. `.gitignore`
5. Default patterns

This feature is especially useful for users of ripgrep, ag, fd, and other modern search tools, enabling consistent ignore patterns across your entire toolchain.

### Repomix Explorer Plugin (#908)
Added the **repomix-explorer** Claude Code plugin that enables intelligent, AI-powered exploration and analysis of codebases using natural language!

**Installation:**
```bash
/plugin marketplace add yamadashy/repomix
/plugin install repomix-explorer@repomix
```

**Usage:**
```bash
# Analyze local codebases
/repomix-explorer:explore-local <path-to-repo>

# Analyze remote GitHub repositories
/repomix-explorer:explore-remote <repo-url>
```

The agent executes `npx repomix@latest` to pack the repository, then uses intelligent search strategies to provide comprehensive analysis without overwhelming context limits.

Learn more in the [Claude Code Plugins documentation](https://repomix.com/guide/claude-code-plugins).

## Bug Fixes 🐛

### Improved Error Handling for Permission Errors and Special Tokens (#907)
- Improved error messages for permission errors with clear solutions
- Fixed token counting errors when processing special tokens (e.g., `<|endoftext|>` in tokenizer files)
- Resolved issues when processing ML/AI projects with tokenizer configurations

## Improvements ⚡

- Upgraded to Zod v4 for improved schema validation (#923)
- Security updates for Vite and Hono dependencies (#913, #917, #920)

## How to Update

```bash
npm update -g repomix
```

## File: .github/releases/v1.x/v1.9.1.md
`````markdown
This release fixes an issue with output file extensions introduced in v1.9.0 and reduces package size, making Repomix more intuitive and efficient!

## Bug Fixes 🐛

### Fixed Output File Extension Not Matching Style (#947)

Fixed an issue where the output file extension didn't automatically match the selected style. Now when you use `--style markdown`, `--style json`, or `--style plain`, the output filename will automatically use the corresponding extension (`.md`, `.json`, or `.txt`).

**Before (v1.9.0):**
```bash
repomix --style markdown
# Output: repomix-output.xml (wrong extension!)
```

**After (v1.9.1):**
```bash
repomix --style markdown
# Output: repomix-output.md ✨
```

This behavior applies when the output filename is not explicitly specified via `--output` or in the config file.

Special thanks to @Ahmad8864 for their first contribution fixing this issue! 🎉

We also appreciate @pranc1ngpegasus for their alternative implementation in #949 and detailed investigation of this issue!

## Improvements ⚡

### Reduced Package Size (#942)

Replaced `tree-sitter-wasms` with `@repomix/tree-sitter-wasms`, which contains only the language parsers needed for Repomix. This reduces the total package size by approximately **25%**, resulting in faster installation times and lower disk usage.

## How to Update

```bash
npm update -g repomix
```

`````markdown
This release improves `.gitignore` handling to better match Git's standard behavior and includes GitHub Actions fixes!

## Improvements ⚡

### Improved .gitignore Handling (#964)

Updated to globby v16 and enhanced `.gitignore` handling to match Git's standard behavior. Parent directory `.gitignore` files are now properly respected, making file filtering more intuitive and consistent with how Git itself operates.

**Key improvements:**
- ✅ Parent directory `.gitignore` files are now properly respected
- ✅ Consistent behavior with Git's standard ignore pattern matching

## Bug Fixes 🐛

### Fixed GitHub Actions `compress` Option (#965)

Fixed a bug where setting `compress: false` in GitHub Actions incorrectly added an unsupported `--no-compress` argument. The logic is now corrected so that `--compress` is only added when explicitly enabled.

Special thanks to @chinchala for their first contribution! 🎉

## How to Update

```bash
npm update -g repomix
```

            You're an assistant that finds similar issues in the repository.

            Issue Information:
            - REPO: ${{ github.repository }}
            - ISSUE_NUMBER: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}

            TASK:

            1. First, get the current issue details:
               ```
               gh issue view ${{ github.event.issue.number }}
               ```

            2. Search for similar issues using keywords from the title and body:
               - Use `gh search issues` with relevant keywords
               - Search in this repository only: `repo:${{ github.repository }}`
               - Exclude the current issue from results
               - Look for both open and closed issues

            3. Analyze the search results and select up to 3 most relevant similar issues:
               - Consider title similarity
               - Consider problem description similarity
               - Prioritize issues that might help the user (solved issues, related discussions)

            4. If you find relevant similar issues (1-3), post a helpful comment:
               - Use `gh issue comment ${{ github.event.issue.number }} --body "..."`
               - Format the comment nicely with links to the similar issues
               - Briefly explain why each issue might be related
               - Use this format:

               ```
               ### Related Issues

               I found some similar issues that might be helpful:

               - #123 - [Title] - Brief reason why it's related
               - #456 - [Title] - Brief reason why it's related

               These might provide additional context or solutions.
               ```

            5. If NO similar issues are found, do NOT post any comment. Simply end the task.

            IMPORTANT:
            - Maximum 3 similar issues
            - Only comment if you find genuinely related issues
            - Do NOT comment if no similar issues are found
            - Be concise in your explanations

            You're an issue triage assistant for the Repomix repository. Your task is to analyze the issue and select appropriate labels from the repository's label list.

            IMPORTANT: Don't post any comments or messages to the issue. Your only action should be to apply labels.

            Issue Information:
            - REPO: ${{ github.repository }}
            - ISSUE_NUMBER: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}

            TASK OVERVIEW:

            1. First, fetch the list of labels available in this repository by running: `gh label list`. Run exactly this command with nothing else.

            2. Next, use gh commands to get context about the issue:
               - Use `gh issue view ${{ github.event.issue.number }}` to retrieve the current issue's details
               - Use `gh search issues` to find similar issues that might provide context for proper categorization

            3. Analyze the issue content, considering:
               - The issue title and description
               - The type of issue (bug report, feature request, question, etc.)
               - Technical areas mentioned (output formats, language parsing, MCP server, security, CLI options, etc.)
               - User impact and severity

            4. Select appropriate labels from the available labels:
               - Choose labels that accurately reflect the issue's nature
               - Common categories for Repomix:
                 - `bug`: Something isn't working correctly
                 - `enhancement`: New feature or improvement request
                 - `question`: User needs help or clarification
                 - `documentation`: Documentation improvements needed
                 - `needs investigation`: Requires deeper analysis to understand
                 - `needs more information`: Issue lacks details to proceed
                 - `needs discussion`: Requires team discussion before action
                 - `good first issue`: Suitable for new contributors
                 - `idea`: Early-stage feature concept
               - If you find similar OPEN issues using gh search, consider using the `duplicate` label

            5. Apply the selected labels:
               - Use `gh issue edit ${{ github.event.issue.number }} --add-label "label1,label2"` to apply your selected labels
               - DO NOT post any comments explaining your decision
               - DO NOT communicate directly with users
               - If no labels are clearly applicable, do not apply any labels

            IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
            - Be thorough in your analysis
            - Only select labels from the repository's available labels
            - DO NOT post any comments to the issue
            - Your ONLY action should be to apply labels using gh issue edit
            - It's okay to not add any labels if none are clearly applicable

## Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev chrome     # Development mode for Chrome
npm run build-all      # Build for all browsers
npm run lint          # TypeScript type checking
npm run test          # Run tests
npm run generate-icons # Generate icon set from SVG
```

## Internationalization

### Supported Languages (11 total)
English, Japanese, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese (Brazilian), Indonesian, Vietnamese, Korean, Chinese (Simplified/Traditional), Hindi.

### Adding New Languages
1. Create directory in `app/_locales/[language_code]/`
2. Add `messages.json` with required keys:
   - `appName`, `appDescription`, `buttonText`
3. Add `detailed-description.txt` for store descriptions
4. Test extension loads correctly with new locale

- `npm run leak:watch` - Continuous monitoring  
- `npm run leak:analyze` - Comprehensive analysis with reports

## Understanding Results

- **Heap Memory**: JavaScript objects (should stabilize)
- **RSS Memory**: Total process memory (watch for growth > 100%)

Look for consistent upward trends that indicate memory leaks.

## Purpose

This is a reference codebase organized into multiple files for AI consumption.
It is designed to be easily searchable using grep and other text-based tools.

## File Structure

This skill contains the following reference files:

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| \`project-structure.md\` | Directory tree with line counts per file |
| \`files.md\` | All file contents (search with \`## File: <path>\`) |
| \`tech-stack.md\` | Languages, frameworks, and dependencies |
| \`summary.md\` | This file - purpose and format explanation |

# {{{projectName}}} Codebase Reference

{{{totalFiles}}} files | {{{totalLines}}} lines | {{{totalTokens}}} tokens

## Overview

Use this skill when you need to:
- Understand project structure and file organization
- Find where specific functionality is implemented
- Read source code for any file
- Search for code patterns or keywords

## Files

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| \`references/summary.md\` | **Start here** - Purpose, format explanation, and statistics |
| \`references/project-structure.md\` | Directory tree with line counts per file |
| \`references/files.md\` | All file contents (search with \`## File: <path>\`) |
{{#if hasTechStack}}
| \`references/tech-stack.md\` | Languages, frameworks, and dependencies |
{{/if}}

## How to Use

### 1. Find file locations

Check \`project-structure.md\` for the directory tree:

\`\`\`
src/
  index.ts (42 lines)
  utils/
    helpers.ts (128 lines)
\`\`\`

### 2. Read file contents

Grep in \`files.md\` for the file path:

\`\`\`
## File: src/utils/helpers.ts
\`\`\`

### 3. Search for code

Grep in \`files.md\` for keywords:

\`\`\`
function calculateTotal
\`\`\`

## Common Use Cases

**Understand a feature:**
1. Search \`project-structure.md\` for related file names
2. Read the main implementation file in \`files.md\`
3. Search for imports/references to trace dependencies

**Debug an error:**
1. Grep the error message or class name in \`files.md\`
2. Check line counts in \`project-structure.md\` to find large files

**Find all usages:**
1. Grep function or variable name in \`files.md\`

## Tips

- Use line counts in \`project-structure.md\` to estimate file complexity
- Search \`## File:\` pattern to jump between files
- Check \`summary.md\` for excluded files, format details, and file statistics
{{#if hasTechStack}}
- Check \`tech-stack.md\` for languages, frameworks, and dependencies
{{/if}}

/**
 * Type definition extension for git-url-parse library
 *
 * This file exists because the git-url-parse library's built-in type definitions
 * are incomplete. The library supports a second 'refs' parameter for the gitUrlParse
 * function, which is documented in the library's README but not included in its
 * type definitions.
 *
 * Without this type definition extension, we would need to use @ts-ignore when
 * calling gitUrlParse with the refs parameter, which reduces type safety and
 * makes the code harder to maintain.
 *
 * This file uses TypeScript's module augmentation feature to extend the existing
 * type definitions without modifying the original library code.

/**
 * Customize default theme styling by overriding CSS variables:
 * https://github.com/vuejs/vitepress/blob/main/src/client/theme-default/styles/vars.css
 */

/**
 * Colors
 *
 * Each colors have exact same color scale system with 3 levels of solid
 * colors with different brightness, and 1 soft color.
 *
 * - `XXX-1`: The most solid color used mainly for colored text. It must
 *   satisfy the contrast ratio against when used on top of `XXX-soft`.
 *
 * - `XXX-2`: The color used mainly for hover state of the button.
 *
 * - `XXX-3`: The color for solid background, such as bg color of the button.
 *   It must satisfy the contrast ratio with pure white (#ffffff) text on
 *   top of it.
 *
 * - `XXX-soft`: The color used for subtle background such as custom container
 *   or badges. It must satisfy the contrast ratio when putting `XXX-1` colors
 *   on top of it.
 *
 *   The soft color must be semi transparent alpha channel. This is crucial
 *   because it allows adding multiple "soft" colors on top of each other
 *   to create a accent, such as when having inline code block inside
 *   custom containers.
 *
 * - `default`: The color used purely for subtle indication without any
 *   special meanings attached to it such as bg color for menu hover state.
 *
 * - `brand`: Used for primary brand colors, such as link text, button with
 *   brand theme, etc.
 *
 * - `tip`: Used to indicate useful information. The default theme uses the
 *   brand color for this by default.
 *
 * - `warning`: Used to indicate warning to the users. Used in custom
 *   container, badges, etc.
 *
 * - `danger`: Used to show error, or dangerous message to the users. Used
 *   in custom container, badges, etc.

# Repomix als Bibliothek verwenden

Neben der Verwendung von Repomix als CLI-Tool können Sie seine Funktionalität direkt in Ihre Node.js-Anwendungen integrieren.

## Installation

Installieren Sie Repomix als Abhängigkeit in Ihrem Projekt:

```bash
npm install repomix
```

## Grundlegende Verwendung

Der einfachste Weg, Repomix zu verwenden, ist über die Funktion `runCli`, die die gleiche Funktionalität wie die Befehlszeilenschnittstelle bietet:

```javascript
import { runCli, type CliOptions } from 'repomix';

// Aktuelles Verzeichnis mit benutzerdefinierten Optionen verarbeiten
async function packProject() {
  const options = {
    output: 'output.xml',
    style: 'xml',
    compress: true,
    quiet: true
  } as CliOptions;
  
  const result = await runCli(['.'], process.cwd(), options);
  return result.packResult;
}
```

Das `result.packResult` enthält Informationen über die verarbeiteten Dateien, darunter:
- `totalFiles`: Anzahl der verarbeiteten Dateien
- `totalCharacters`: Gesamtanzahl der Zeichen
- `totalTokens`: Gesamtanzahl der Tokens (nützlich für LLM-Kontextgrenzen)
- `fileCharCounts`: Zeichenanzahl pro Datei
- `fileTokenCounts`: Token-Anzahl pro Datei

## Verarbeitung von Remote-Repositories

Sie können ein Remote-Repository klonen und verarbeiten:

```javascript
import { runCli, type CliOptions } from 'repomix';

// GitHub-Repository klonen und verarbeiten
async function processRemoteRepo(repoUrl) {
  const options = {
    remote: repoUrl,
    output: 'output.xml',
    compress: true
  } as CliOptions;
  
  return await runCli(['.'], process.cwd(), options);
}
```

## Verwendung der Kernkomponenten

Für mehr Kontrolle können Sie die Low-Level-APIs von Repomix direkt verwenden:

```javascript
import { searchFiles, collectFiles, processFiles, TokenCounter } from 'repomix';

async function analyzeFiles(directory) {
  // Dateien suchen und sammeln
  const { filePaths } = await searchFiles(directory, { /* Konfiguration */ });
  const rawFiles = await collectFiles(filePaths, directory);
  const processedFiles = await processFiles(rawFiles, { /* Konfiguration */ });
  
  // Tokens zählen
  const tokenCounter = new TokenCounter('o200k_base');
  
  // Analyseergebnisse zurückgeben
  return processedFiles.map(file => ({
    path: file.path,
    tokens: tokenCounter.countTokens(file.content)
  }));
}
```

## Reales Beispiel

Die Repomix-Website ([repomix.com](https://repomix.com)) verwendet Repomix als Bibliothek zur Verarbeitung von Remote-Repositories. Sie können die Implementierung in [website/server/src/remoteRepo.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/....ts) sehen.

# Best Practices für KI-unterstützte Entwicklung: Aus meiner Erfahrung

Obwohl ich noch kein großes Projekt mit KI erfolgreich abgeschlossen habe, möchte ich meine bisherigen Erfahrungen in der Entwicklung mit KI teilen.

## Grundlegender Entwicklungsansatz

Bei der Arbeit mit KI kann der Versuch, alle Funktionen auf einmal zu implementieren, zu unerwarteten Problemen und Projektstillstand führen. Deshalb ist es effektiver, mit der Kernfunktionalität zu beginnen und jede Funktion einzeln aufzubauen, wobei eine solide Implementierung sichergestellt wird, bevor man weitermacht.

### Die Kraft des bestehenden Codes

Dieser Ansatz ist effektiv, weil die Implementierung der Kernfunktionalität es Ihnen ermöglicht, Ihr ideales Design und Ihren Codierungsstil durch tatsächlichen Code zu materialisieren. Der effektivste Weg, Ihre Projektvision zu kommunizieren, ist durch Code, der Ihre Standards und Präferenzen widerspiegelt.

Indem Sie mit Kernfunktionen beginnen und sicherstellen, dass jede Komponente richtig funktioniert, bevor Sie weitergehen, behält das gesamte Projekt seine Konsistenz, was es der KI erleichtert, angemesseneren Code zu generieren.

## Der modulare 

Ansatz
Code in kleinere Module aufzuteilen ist entscheidend. Nach meiner Erfahrung macht es die Begrenzung von Dateien auf etwa 250 Codezeilen einfacher, der KI klare Anweisungen zu geben und den Versuch-und-Irrtum-Prozess effizienter zu gestalten. Während die Token-Anzahl ein genaueres Maß wäre, ist die Zeilenanzahl für menschliche Entwickler praktischer, daher verwenden wir diese als Richtlinie.

Diese Modularisierung beschränkt sich nicht nur auf die Trennung von Frontend, Backend und Datenbankkomponenten - es geht darum, die Funktionalität auf einer viel feineren Ebene aufzuteilen. Zum Beispiel könnten Sie innerhalb einer einzelnen Funktion die Validierung, Fehlerbehandlung und andere spezifische Funktionalitäten in separate Module aufteilen.

## Qualitätssicherung durch Tests

Ich halte Tests für entscheidend in der KI-unterstützten Entwicklung. Tests dienen nicht nur als Qualitätssicherungsmaßnahmen, sondern auch als Dokumentation, die die Codeabsichten klar demonstriert. Wenn Sie die KI bitten, neue Funktionen zu implementieren, fungiert der bestehende Testcode effektiv als Spezifikationsdokument.

Tests sind auch ein ausgezeichnetes Werkzeug zur Validierung der Korrektheit von KI-generiertem Code. Wenn Sie beispielsweise die KI neue Funktionalität für ein Modul implementieren lassen, ermöglicht das vorherige Schreiben von Testfällen eine objektive Bewertung, ob der generierte Code wie erwartet funktioniert.

## Balance zwischen Planung und Implementierung

Bevor Sie umfangreiche Funktionen implementieren, empfehle ich, zunächst den Plan mit der KI zu besprechen. Die Organisation von Anforderungen und die Berücksichtigung der Architektur führen zu einer reibungsloseren Implementierung. Eine gute Praxis ist es, zuerst die Anforderungen zusammenzustellen und dann zu einer separaten Chat-Sitzung für die Implementierungsarbeit überzugehen.

## Fazit

Durch die Befolgung dieser Praktiken können Sie die Stärken der KI nutzen und gleichzeitig eine konsistente, hochwertige Codebasis aufbauen. Selbst wenn Ihr Projekt wächst, bleibt jede Komponente gut definiert und handhabbar.

# Agent Skills Generierung

Repomix kann Ausgaben im Format von [Claude Agent Skills](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) generieren und dabei ein strukturiertes Skills-Verzeichnis erstellen, das als wiederverwendbare Codebase-Referenz für KI-Assistenten dient.

Diese Funktion ist besonders leistungsfähig, wenn Sie Implementierungen aus entfernten Repositories referenzieren möchten. Durch die Generierung von Skills aus Open-Source-Projekten können Sie Claude einfach bitten, spezifische Muster oder Implementierungen zu referenzieren, während Sie an Ihrem eigenen Code arbeiten.

Anstatt eine einzelne gepackte Datei zu generieren, erstellt die Skills-Generierung ein strukturiertes Verzeichnis mit mehreren Referenzdateien, die für KI-Verständnis und grep-freundliche Suche optimiert sind.

> [!NOTE]
> Dies ist eine experimentelle Funktion. Das Ausgabeformat und die Optionen können sich in zukünftigen Versionen basierend auf Benutzer-Feedback ändern.

## Grundlegende Verwendung

Skills aus Ihrem lokalen Verzeichnis generieren:

```bash
# Skills aus dem aktuellen Verzeichnis generieren
repomix --skill-generate

# Mit benutzerdefiniertem Skills-Namen generieren
repomix --skill-generate my-project-reference

# Aus bestimmtem Verzeichnis generieren
repomix path/to/directory --skill-generate

# Aus entferntem Repository generieren
repomix --remote https://github.com/user/repo --skill-generate
```

## Skills-Speicherort-Auswahl

Wenn Sie den Befehl ausführen, fordert Repomix Sie auf, den Speicherort für die Skills zu wählen:

1. **Personal Skills** (`~/.claude/skills/`) - Verfügbar für alle Projekte auf Ihrem Rechner
2. **Project Skills** (`.claude/skills/`) - Mit Ihrem Team über Git geteilt

Wenn das Skills-Verzeichnis bereits existiert, werden Sie aufgefordert, das Überschreiben zu bestätigen.

> [!TIP]
> Wenn Sie Project Skills generieren, sollten Sie diese zur `.gitignore` hinzufügen, um das Committen großer Dateien zu vermeiden:
> ```gitignore
> .claude/skills/repomix-reference-*/
> ```

## Generierte Struktur

Die Skills werden mit folgender Struktur generiert:

```text
.claude/skills/<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md                    # Haupt-Skills-Metadaten & Dokumentation
└── references/
    ├── summary.md              # Zweck, Format und Statistiken
    ├── project-structure.md    # Verzeichnisbaum mit Zeilenzahlen
    ├── files.md                # Alle Dateiinhalte (grep-freundlich)
    └── tech-stack.md           # Sprachen, Frameworks, Abhängigkeiten
```

### Dateibeschreibungen

#### SKILL.md

Die Haupt-Skills-Datei enthält:
- Skills-Name, Beschreibung und Projektinformationen
- Dateianzahl, Zeilenanzahl und Token-Anzahl
- Übersicht zur Verwendung der Skills
- Dateispeicherorte und Formaterklärung
- Häufige Anwendungsfälle und Tipps

#### references/summary.md

Enthält:
- **Zweck**: Erklärt, dass dies eine Referenz-Codebase für KI-Nutzung ist
- **Dateistruktur**: Dokumentiert den Inhalt jeder Referenzdatei
- **Nutzungsrichtlinien**: Wie die Skills effektiv verwendet werden
- **Statistiken**: Aufschlüsselung nach Dateityp, Sprache und größten Dateien

#### references/project-structure.md

Verzeichnisbaum mit Zeilenzahlen pro Datei zur einfachen Dateifindung:

```text
src/
  index.ts (42 lines)
  utils/
    helpers.ts (128 lines)
    math.ts (87 lines)
```

#### references/files.md

Alle Dateiinhalte mit Syntax-Highlighting-Headern, optimiert für grep-freundliche Suche:

````markdown
## File: src/index.ts
```typescript
import { sum } from './utils/helpers';

export function main() {
  console.log(sum(1, 2));
}
```
````

#### references/tech-stack.md

Automatisch erkannter Tech-Stack aus Abhängigkeitsdateien:
- **Sprachen**: TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, usw.
- **Frameworks**: React, Next.js, Express, Django, usw.
- **Laufzeitversionen**: Node.js, Python, Go, usw.
- **Paketmanager**: npm, pnpm, poetry, usw.
- **Abhängigkeiten**: Alle direkten und Entwicklungs-Abhängigkeiten
- **Konfigurationsdateien**: Alle erkannten Konfigurationsdateien

Erkannt aus Dateien wie: `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `.nvmrc`, `pyproject.toml`, usw.

## Automatisch generierte Skills-Namen

Wenn kein Name angegeben wird, generiert Repomix automatisch einen mit diesem Muster:

```bash
repomix src/ --skill-generate                # → repomix-reference-src
repomix --remote user/repo --skill-generate  # → repomix-reference-repo
repomix --skill-generate CustomName          # → custom-name (normalisiert zu kebab-case)
```

Skills-Namen werden:
- In kebab-case konvertiert (Kleinbuchstaben, durch Bindestriche getrennt)
- Auf maximal 64 Zeichen begrenzt
- Gegen Pfad-Traversierung geschützt

## Integration mit Repomix-Optionen

Die Skills-Generierung respektiert alle Standard-Repomix-Optionen:

```bash
# Skills mit Dateifilterung generieren
repomix --skill-generate --include "src/**/*.ts" --ignore "**/*.test.ts"

# Skills mit Komprimierung generieren
repomix --skill-generate --compress

# Skills aus entferntem Repository generieren
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix --skill-generate

# Skills mit spezifischen Ausgabeformat-Optionen generieren
repomix --skill-generate --remove-comments --remove-empty-lines
```

### Nur-Dokumentations-Skills

Mit `--include` können Sie Skills generieren, die nur die Dokumentation aus einem GitHub-Repository enthalten. Dies ist nützlich, wenn Sie Claude auf spezifische Bibliotheks- oder Framework-Dokumentation verweisen möchten, während Sie an Ihrem Code arbeiten:

```bash
# Claude Code Action Dokumentation
repomix --remote https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action --include docs --skill-generate

# Vite Dokumentation
repomix --remote https://github.com/vitejs/vite --include docs --skill-generate

# React Dokumentation
repomix --remote https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev --include src/content --skill-generate
```

## Einschränkungen

Die Option `--skill-generate` kann nicht verwendet werden mit:
- `--stdout` - Skills-Ausgabe erfordert Schreiben ins Dateisystem
- `--copy` - Skills-Ausgabe ist ein Verzeichnis, nicht in die Zwischenablage kopierbar

## Generierte Skills verwenden

Sobald generiert, können Sie die Skills mit Claude verwenden:

1. **Claude Code**: Die Skills sind automatisch verfügbar, wenn sie unter `~/.claude/skills/` oder `.claude/skills/` gespeichert sind
2. **Claude Web**: Laden Sie das Skills-Verzeichnis zur Codebase-Analyse zu Claude hoch
3. **Team-Teilen**: Committen Sie `.claude/skills/` in Ihr Repository für teamweiten Zugriff

## Beispiel-Workflow

### Persönliche Referenzbibliothek erstellen

```bash
# Ein interessantes Open-Source-Projekt klonen und analysieren
repomix --remote facebook/react --skill-generate react-reference

# Die Skills werden unter ~/.claude/skills/react-reference/ gespeichert
# Jetzt können Sie Reacts Codebase in jeder Claude-Konversation referenzieren
```

### Team-Projekt-Dokumentation

```bash
# In Ihrem Projektverzeichnis
cd my-project

# Skills für Ihr Team generieren
repomix --skill-generate

# Wählen Sie "Project Skills" wenn aufgefordert
# Die Skills werden unter .claude/skills/repomix-reference-my-project/ gespeichert

# Committen und mit Ihrem Team teilen
git add .claude/skills/
git commit -m "Add codebase reference Skills"
```

# Code-Komprimierung

Die Code-Komprimierung ist eine leistungsstarke Funktion, die wichtige Code-Strukturen intelligent extrahiert und dabei Implementierungsdetails entfernt. Dies ist besonders nützlich, um die Token-Anzahl zu reduzieren und gleichzeitig wichtige strukturelle Informationen über Ihre Codebasis beizubehalten.

> [!NOTE]
> Dies ist eine experimentelle Funktion, die wir basierend auf Benutzerfeedback und praktischer Nutzung aktiv verbessern werden.

## Grundlegende Verwendung

Aktivieren Sie die Code-Komprimierung mit der Option `--compress`:

```bash
repomix --compress
```

Sie können sie auch mit Remote-Repositories verwenden:

```bash
repomix --remote user/repo --compress
```

## Funktionsweise

Der Komprimierungsalgorithmus verarbeitet Code mithilfe von Tree-Sitter-Parsing, um wesentliche strukturelle Elemente zu extrahieren und zu bewahren, während Implementierungsdetails entfernt werden.

Die Komprimierung bewahrt:
- Funktions- und Methodensignaturen
- Schnittstellen- und Typdefinitionen
- Klassenstrukturen und Eigenschaften
- Wichtige strukturelle Elemente

Während sie entfernt:
- Funktions- und Methodenimplementierungen
- Details zu Schleifen- und Bedingungslogik
- Interne Variablendeklarationen
- Implementierungsspezifischen Code

### Beispiel

Ursprünglicher TypeScript-Code:

```typescript
import { ShoppingItem } from './shopping-item';

/**
 * Calculate the total price of shopping items
 */
const calculateTotal = (
  items: ShoppingItem[]
) => {
  let total = 0;
  for (const item of items) {
    total += item.price * item.quantity;
  }
  return total;
}

// Shopping item interface
interface Item {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  quantity: number;
}
```

Nach der Komprimierung:

```typescript
import { ShoppingItem } from './shopping-item';
⋮----
/**
 * Calculate the total price of shopping items
 */
const calculateTotal = (
  items: ShoppingItem[]
) => {
⋮----
// Shopping item interface
interface Item {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  quantity: number;
}
```

## Konfiguration

Sie können die Komprimierung in Ihrer Konfigurationsdatei aktivieren:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "compress": true
  }
}
```

## Anwendungsfälle

Die Code-Komprimierung ist besonders nützlich wenn:
- Code-Struktur und Architektur analysiert werden
- Token-Anzahl für LLM-Verarbeitung reduziert werden soll
- Hochrangige Dokumentation erstellt wird
- Code-Muster und Signaturen verstanden werden sollen
- API- und Schnittstellendesigns geteilt werden

## Verwandte Optionen

Sie können die Komprimierung mit anderen Optionen kombinieren:
- `--remove-comments`: Code-Kommentare entfernen
- `--remove-empty-lines`: Leere Zeilen entfernen
- `--output-show-line-numbers`: Zeilennummern zur Ausgabe hinzufügen

# Kommentarentfernung

Repomix kann beim Generieren der Ausgabedatei automatisch Kommentare aus Ihrer Codebasis entfernen. Dies kann helfen, Störungen zu reduzieren und sich auf den eigentlichen Code zu konzentrieren.

## Verwendung

Um die Kommentarentfernung zu aktivieren, setzen Sie die Option `removeComments` in Ihrer `repomix.config.json` auf `true`:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "removeComments": true
  }
}
```

## Unterstützte Sprachen

Repomix unterstützt die Kommentarentfernung für eine Vielzahl von Programmiersprachen, einschließlich:

- JavaScript/TypeScript (`//`, `/* */`)
- Python (`#`, `"""`, `'''`)
- Java (`//`, `/* */`)
- C/C++ (`//`, `/* */`)
- HTML (`<!-- -->`)
- CSS (`/* */`)
- Und viele mehr...

## Beispiel

Gegeben sei der folgende JavaScript-Code:

```javascript
// Dies ist ein einzeiliger Kommentar
function test() {
  /* Dies ist ein
     mehrzeiliger Kommentar */
  return true;
}
```

Mit aktivierter Kommentarentfernung wird die Ausgabe wie folgt aussehen:

```javascript
function test() {
  return true;
}
```

## Hinweise

- Die Kommentarentfernung wird vor anderen Verarbeitungsschritten durchgeführt, wie z.B. der Zeilennummerierung.
- Einige Kommentare, wie JSDoc-Kommentare, können je nach Sprache und Kontext erhalten bleiben.

# Konfiguration

Repomix kann über eine Konfigurationsdatei oder Kommandozeilenoptionen konfiguriert werden. Die Konfigurationsdatei ermöglicht es Ihnen, die Verarbeitung und Ausgabe Ihres Codes anzupassen.

## Konfigurationsdateiformate

Repomix unterstützt mehrere Konfigurationsdateiformate für Flexibilität und Benutzerfreundlichkeit.

Repomix sucht automatisch nach Konfigurationsdateien in der folgenden Prioritätsreihenfolge:

1. **TypeScript** (`repomix.config.ts`, `repomix.config.mts`, `repomix.config.cts`)
2. **JavaScript/ES Module** (`repomix.config.js`, `repomix.config.mjs`, `repomix.config.cjs`)
3. **JSON** (`repomix.config.json5`, `repomix.config.jsonc`, `repomix.config.json`)

### JSON-Konfiguration

Erstellen Sie eine Konfigurationsdatei in Ihrem Projektverzeichnis:
```bash
repomix --init
```

Dies erstellt eine `repomix.config.json`-Datei mit Standardeinstellungen. Sie können auch eine globale Konfigurationsdatei erstellen, die als Fallback verwendet wird, wenn keine lokale Konfiguration gefunden wird:

```bash
repomix --init --global
```

### TypeScript-Konfiguration

TypeScript-Konfigurationsdateien bieten die beste Entwicklererfahrung mit vollständiger Typüberprüfung und IDE-Unterstützung.

**Installation:**

Um TypeScript- oder JavaScript-Konfiguration mit `defineConfig` zu verwenden, müssen Sie Repomix als Entwicklungsabhängigkeit installieren:

```bash
npm install -D repomix
```

**Beispiel:**

```typescript
// repomix.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'repomix';

export default defineConfig({
  output: {
    filePath: 'output.xml',
    style: 'xml',
    removeComments: true,
  },
  ignore: {
    customPatterns: ['**/node_modules/**', '**/dist/**'],
  },
});
```

**Vorteile:**
- ✅ Vollständige TypeScript-Typüberprüfung in Ihrer IDE
- ✅ Hervorragende IDE-Autovervollständigung und IntelliSense
- ✅ Verwendung dynamischer Werte (Zeitstempel, Umgebungsvariablen usw.)

**Beispiel für dynamische Werte:**

```typescript
// repomix.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'repomix';

// Zeitstempel-basierten Dateinamen generieren
const timestamp = new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 19).replace(/[:.]/g, '-');

export default defineConfig({
  output: {
    filePath: `output-${timestamp}.xml`,
    style: 'xml',
  },
});
```

### JavaScript-Konfiguration

JavaScript-Konfigurationsdateien funktionieren genauso wie TypeScript und unterstützen `defineConfig` und dynamische Werte.

- Flexiblere String-Syntax

## Schema-Validierung

Sie können die Schema-Validierung für Ihre Konfigurationsdatei aktivieren, indem Sie die Eigenschaft `$schema` hinzufügen:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://repomix.com/schemas/latest/schema.json",
  "output": {
    "filePath": "repomix-output.md",
    "style": "markdown"
  }
}
```

Dies bietet Autovervollständigung und Validierung in Editoren, die JSON-Schema unterstützen.

## Beispiel-Konfigurationsdatei

Hier ist ein Beispiel einer vollständigen Konfigurationsdatei (`repomix.config.json`):

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://repomix.com/schemas/latest/schema.json",
  "input": {
    "maxFileSize": 50000000
  },
  "output": {
    "filePath": "repomix-output.xml",
    "style": "xml",
    "parsableStyle": false,
    "compress": false,
    "headerText": "Benutzerdefinierte Header-Informationen für die gepackte Datei",
    "fileSummary": true,
    "directoryStructure": true,
    "files": true,
    "removeComments": false,
    "removeEmptyLines": false,
    "topFilesLength": 5,

    "git": {
      "sortByChanges": true,
      "sortByChangesMaxCommits": 100,
      "includeDiffs": false,
      "includeLogs": false,
      "includeLogsCount": 50
    }
  },
  "include": ["**/*"],
  "ignore": {
    "useGitignore": true,
    "useDefaultPatterns": true,
    // Muster können auch in .repomixignore angegeben werden
    "customPatterns": [
      "additional-folder",
      "**/*.log"
    ],
  },
  "security": {
    "enableSecurityCheck": true
  },
  "tokenCount": {
    "encoding": "o200k_base"
  }
}
```

## Speicherorte der Konfigurationsdatei

Repomix sucht in folgender Reihenfolge nach Konfigurationsdateien:
1. Lokale Konfigurationsdatei im aktuellen Verzeichnis (Priorität: TS > JS > JSON)
   - TypeScript: `repomix.config.ts`, `repomix.config.mts`, `repomix.config.cts`
   - JavaScript: `repomix.config.js`, `repomix.config.mjs`, `repomix.config.cjs`
   - JSON: `repomix.config.json5`, `repomix.config.jsonc`, `repomix.config.json`
2. Globale Konfigurationsdatei (Priorität: TS > JS > JSON)
   - Windows:
     - TypeScript: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.ts`, `.mts`, `.cts`
     - JavaScript: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`
     - JSON: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.json5`, `.jsonc`, `.json`
   - macOS/Linux:
     - TypeScript: `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.ts`, `.mts`, `.cts`
     - JavaScript: `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`
     - JSON: `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.json5`, `.jsonc`, `.json`

Kommandozeilenoptionen haben Vorrang vor Einstellungen in der Konfigurationsdatei.

## Include-Muster

Repomix unterstützt die Angabe einzuschließender Dateien mittels [Glob-Mustern](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax). Dies ermöglicht eine flexiblere und leistungsfähigere Dateiauswahl:

- Verwenden Sie `**/*.js`, um alle JavaScript-Dateien in jedem Verzeichnis einzuschließen
- Verwenden Sie `src/**/*`, um alle Dateien innerhalb des `src`-Verzeichnisses und seiner Unterverzeichnisse einzuschließen
- Kombinieren Sie mehrere Muster wie `["src/**/*.js", "**/*.md"]`, um JavaScript-Dateien in `src` und alle Markdown-Dateien einzuschließen

Sie können Include-Muster in Ihrer Konfigurationsdatei angeben:

```json
{
  "include": ["src/**/*", "tests/**/*.test.js"]
}
```

Oder verwenden Sie die Kommandozeilenoption `--include` für einmaliges Filtern.

## Ignorier-Muster

Repomix bietet mehrere Methoden zum Festlegen von Ignorier-Mustern, um bestimmte Dateien oder Verzeichnisse während des Packprozesses auszuschließen:

- **.gitignore**: Standardmäßig werden die in den `.gitignore`-Dateien und `.git/info/exclude` Ihres Projekts aufgelisteten Muster verwendet. Dieses Verhalten kann über die Einstellung `ignore.useGitignore` oder die CLI-Option `--no-gitignore` gesteuert werden.
- **.ignore**: Sie können eine `.ignore`-Datei im Stammverzeichnis Ihres Projekts verwenden, die dem gleichen Format wie `.gitignore` folgt. Diese Datei wird von Tools wie ripgrep und the silver searcher respektiert und reduziert die Notwendigkeit, mehrere Ignorier-Dateien zu pflegen. Dieses Verhalten kann über die Einstellung `ignore.useDotIgnore` oder die CLI-Option `--no-dot-ignore` gesteuert werden.
- **Standardmuster**: Repomix enthält eine Standardliste häufig ausgeschlossener Dateien und Verzeichnisse (z.B. node_modules, .git, Binärdateien). Diese Funktion kann über die Einstellung `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` oder die CLI-Option `--no-default-patterns` gesteuert werden. Weitere Details finden Sie in [defaultIgnore.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/src/config/defaultIgnore.ts).
- **.repomixignore**: Sie können eine `.repomixignore`-Datei in Ihrem Projektstamm erstellen, um Repomix-spezifische Ignorier-Muster zu definieren. Diese Datei folgt dem gleichen Format wie `.gitignore`.
- **Benutzerdefinierte Muster**: Zusätzliche Ignorier-Muster können über die Option `ignore.customPatterns` in der Konfigurationsdatei angegeben werden. Sie können diese Einstellung mit der Kommandozeilenoption `-i, --ignore` überschreiben.

**Prioritätsreihenfolge** (von höchster zu niedrigster):

1. Benutzerdefinierte Muster (`ignore.customPatterns`)
2. Ignorier-Dateien (`.repomixignore`, `.ignore`, `.gitignore` und `.git/info/exclude`):
   - Bei verschachtelten Verzeichnissen haben Dateien in tieferen Verzeichnissen höhere Priorität
   - Bei Dateien im selben Verzeichnis werden diese ohne bestimmte Reihenfolge zusammengeführt
3. Standardmuster (wenn `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` true ist und `--no-default-patterns` nicht verwendet wird)

Dieser Ansatz ermöglicht eine flexible Konfiguration des Dateiausschlusses basierend auf den Anforderungen Ihres Projekts. Er hilft, die Größe der generierten Packdatei zu optimieren, indem er den Ausschluss sicherheitssensibler Dateien und großer Binärdateien gewährleistet und gleichzeitig die Preisgabe vertraulicher Informationen verhindert.

**Hinweis:** Binärdateien werden standardmäßig nicht in der gepackten Ausgabe enthalten, aber ihre Pfade werden im Abschnitt "Repository-Struktur" der Ausgabedatei aufgelistet. Dies bietet einen vollständigen Überblick über die Repository-Struktur und hält gleichzeitig die gepackte Datei effizient und textbasiert. Weitere Details finden Sie unter [Binärdateiverarbeitung](#binärdateiverarbeitung).

Beispiel für `.repomixignore`:
```text
# Cache-Verzeichnisse
.cache/
tmp/

# Build-Ausgaben
dist/
build/

# Logs
*.log
```

## Standard-Ignorier-Muster

Wenn `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` true ist, ignoriert Repomix automatisch folgende häufige Muster:
```text
node_modules/**
.git/**
coverage/**
dist/**
```

Die vollständige Liste finden Sie in [defaultIgnore.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/src/config/defaultIgnore.ts)

## Binärdateiverarbeitung

Binärdateien (wie Bilder, PDFs, kompilierte Binärdateien, Archive usw.) werden speziell behandelt, um eine effiziente, textbasierte Ausgabe zu gewährleisten:

- **Dateiinhalte**: Binärdateien werden **nicht** in die gepackte Ausgabe aufgenommen, um die Datei textbasiert und effizient für die KI-Verarbeitung zu halten
- **Verzeichnisstruktur**: Binärdateipfade werden im Abschnitt der Verzeichnisstruktur **aufgelistet**, um einen vollständigen Überblick über Ihr Repository zu bieten

Dieser Ansatz stellt sicher, dass Sie eine vollständige Ansicht Ihrer Repository-Struktur erhalten und gleichzeitig eine effiziente, textbasierte Ausgabe beibehalten, die für den KI-Konsum optimiert ist.

**Beispiel:**

Wenn Ihr Repository `logo.png` und `app.jar` enthält:
- Sie erscheinen im Abschnitt Verzeichnisstruktur
- Ihre Inhalte werden nicht im Abschnitt Dateien enthalten sein

**Verzeichnisstruktur-Ausgabe:**
```
src/
  index.ts
  utils.ts
assets/
  logo.png
build/
  app.jar
```

Auf diese Weise können KI-Tools verstehen, dass diese Binärdateien in Ihrer Projektstruktur existieren, ohne deren Binärinhalte zu verarbeiten.

**Hinweis:** Sie können den Schwellenwert für die maximale Dateigröße über die Konfigurationsoption `input.maxFileSize` steuern (Standard: 50MB). Dateien, die größer als dieser Grenzwert sind, werden vollständig übersprungen.

## Erweiterte Funktionen

### Code-Komprimierung

Die Code-Komprimierungsfunktion (aktiviert durch `output.compress: true`) verwendet [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter), um wesentliche Code-Strukturen intelligent zu extrahieren und dabei Implementierungsdetails zu entfernen. Dies hilft, die Token-Anzahl zu reduzieren und gleichzeitig wichtige strukturelle Informationen beizubehalten.

Hauptvorteile:
- Signifikante Reduzierung der Token-Anzahl
- Beibehaltung von Klassen- und Funktionssignaturen
- Beibehaltung von Imports und Exports
- Beibehaltung von Typdefinitionen und Interfaces
- Entfernung von Funktionskörpern und Implementierungsdetails

Weitere Details und Beispiele finden Sie im [Code-Komprimierungs-Leitfaden](code-compress).

### Git-Integration

Die `output.git`-Konfiguration bietet leistungsstarke Git-bewusste Funktionen:

- `sortByChanges`: Wenn auf true gesetzt, werden Dateien nach der Anzahl der Git-Änderungen (Commits, die die Datei modifiziert haben) sortiert. Häufiger geänderte Dateien erscheinen am Ende der Ausgabe. Dies hilft, aktiver entwickelte Dateien zu priorisieren. Standard: `true`
- `sortByChangesMaxCommits`: Maximale Anzahl zu analysierender Commits bei der Zählung von Dateiänderungen. Standard: `100`
- `includeDiffs`: Wenn auf true gesetzt, werden Git-Unterschiede in die Ausgabe einbezogen (enthält sowohl Arbeitsverzeichnis- als auch Stage-Änderungen separat). Dies ermöglicht es dem Leser, ausstehende Änderungen im Repository zu sehen. Standard: `false`
- `includeLogs`: Wenn auf true gesetzt, werden Git-Logs in die Ausgabe einbezogen. Zeigt Commit-Historie mit Daten, Nachrichten und Dateipfaden für jeden Commit an. Dies hilft der KI, Entwicklungsmuster und Dateibeziehungen zu verstehen. Standard: `false`
- `includeLogsCount`: Die Anzahl der letzten Commits, die in die Git-Logs einbezogen werden sollen. Standard: `50`

Beispielkonfiguration:
```json
{
  "output": {
    "git": {
      "sortByChanges": true,
      "sortByChangesMaxCommits": 100,
      "includeDiffs": true,
      "includeLogs": true,
      "includeLogsCount": 25
    }
  }
}
```

### Sicherheitsprüfungen

Wenn `security.enableSecurityCheck` aktiviert ist, verwendet Repomix [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint), um sensible Informationen zu erkennen, bevor der Code in die Ausgabe aufgenommen wird. Dies hilft, versehentliche Offenlegung zu verhindern von:

- API-Schlüsseln
- Zugriffstoken
- Privaten Schlüsseln
- Passwörtern
- Anderen sensiblen Anmeldeinformationen

### Kommentarentfernung

Wenn `output.removeComments` auf `true` gesetzt ist, werden Kommentare aus unterstützten Dateitypen entfernt, um die Ausgabegröße zu reduzieren und sich auf den wesentlichen Code-Inhalt zu konzentrieren. Dies ist besonders nützlich in folgenden Fällen:

- Verarbeitung stark dokumentierten Codes
- Versuch, die Token-Anzahl zu reduzieren
- Fokussierung auf Code-Struktur und -Logik

Unterstützte Sprachen und detaillierte Beispiele finden Sie im [Kommentarentfernungs-Leitfaden](comment-removal).

# Benutzerdefinierte Anweisungen

Repomix ermöglicht es Ihnen, benutzerdefinierte Anweisungen bereitzustellen, die in die Ausgabedatei aufgenommen werden. Dies kann nützlich sein, um Kontext oder spezifische Richtlinien für KI-Systeme hinzuzufügen, die das Repository verarbeiten.

## Verwendung

Um eine benutzerdefinierte Anweisung einzufügen, erstellen Sie eine Markdown-Datei (z.B. `repomix-instruction.md`) im Stammverzeichnis Ihres Repositories. Geben Sie dann den Pfad zu dieser Datei in Ihrer `repomix.config.json` an:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "instructionFilePath": "repomix-instruction.md"
  }
}
```

Der Inhalt dieser Datei wird in der Ausgabe unter dem Abschnitt "Instruction" aufgenommen.

## Beispiel

```markdown
# Repository-Anweisungen

Dieses Repository enthält den Quellcode für das Repomix-Tool. Bitte beachten Sie diese Richtlinien bei der Analyse des Codes:

1. Konzentrieren Sie sich auf die Kernfunktionalität im Verzeichnis `src/core`.
2. Achten Sie besonders auf die Sicherheitsprüfungen in `src/core/security`.
3. Ignorieren Sie alle Dateien im Verzeichnis `tests`.
```

Dies führt zu folgendem Abschnitt in der Ausgabe:

```xml
<instruction>
# Repository-Anweisungen

Dieses Repository enthält den Quellcode für das Repomix-Tool. Bitte beachten Sie diese Richtlinien bei der Analyse des Codes:

1. Konzentrieren Sie sich auf die Kernfunktionalität im Verzeichnis `src/core`.
2. Achten Sie besonders auf die Sicherheitsprüfungen in `src/core/security`.
3. Ignorieren Sie alle Dateien im Verzeichnis `tests`.

`````markdown
# MCP-Server

Repomix unterstützt das [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), das es KI-Assistenten ermöglicht, direkt mit Ihrer Codebasis zu interagieren. Wenn Repomix als MCP-Server ausgeführt wird, stellt es Tools bereit, die es KI-Assistenten ermöglichen, lokale oder entfernte Repositories ohne manuelle Dateivorbereitung für die Analyse zu verpacken.

> [!NOTE]  
> Dies ist eine experimentelle Funktion, die wir basierend auf Benutzerfeedback und praktischer Nutzung aktiv verbessern werden

## Repomix als MCP-Server ausführen

Um Repomix als MCP-Server auszuführen, verwenden Sie die `--mcp`-Flag:

```bash
repomix --mcp
```

Dadurch wird Repomix im MCP-Server-Modus gestartet und steht KI-Assistenten zur Verfügung, die das Model Context Protocol unterstützen.

## MCP-Server konfigurieren

Um Repomix als MCP-Server mit KI-Assistenten wie Claude zu verwenden, müssen Sie die MCP-Einstellungen konfigurieren:

### Für VS Code

Sie können den Repomix MCP-Server in VS Code mit einer dieser Methoden installieren:

1. **Über das Installations-Badge:**

  [![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-VS_Code?style=flat-square&label=Install%20Server&color=0098FF)](vscode:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22repomix%22%2C%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22repomix%22%2C%22--mcp%22%5D%7D)<br>

```bash
claude mcp add repomix -- npx -y repomix --mcp
```

Alternativ können Sie die **offiziellen Repomix-Plugins** für ein komfortableres Erlebnis verwenden. Die Plugins bieten natürlichsprachliche Befehle und eine einfachere Einrichtung. Weitere Informationen finden Sie in der Dokumentation [Claude Code Plugins](/de/guide/claude-code-plugins).

### Docker anstelle von npx verwenden

Anstatt npx zu verwenden, können Sie auch Docker verwenden, um Repomix als MCP-Server auszuführen:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "repomix-docker": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix",
        "--mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Verfügbare MCP-Tools

Wenn Repomix als MCP-Server ausgeführt wird, stellt es die folgenden Tools bereit:

### pack_codebase

Dieses Tool verpackt ein lokales Code-Verzeichnis in eine XML-Datei für die KI-Analyse. Es analysiert die Codebase-Struktur, extrahiert relevanten Code-Inhalt und generiert einen umfassenden Bericht mit Metriken, Dateibaum und formatiertem Code-Inhalt.

**Parameter:**
- `directory`: (Erforderlich) Absoluter Pfad zum zu verpackenden Verzeichnis
- `compress`: (Optional, Standard: false) Aktiviert Tree-sitter-Komprimierung zur Extraktion wesentlicher Code-Signaturen und -Strukturen bei gleichzeitiger Entfernung von Implementierungsdetails. Reduziert die Token-Nutzung um ~70% bei Beibehaltung der semantischen Bedeutung. Normalerweise nicht erforderlich, da grep_repomix_output inkrementelle Inhaltsabrufung ermöglicht. Verwenden Sie dies nur, wenn Sie speziell den gesamten Codebase-Inhalt für große Repositories benötigen.
- `includePatterns`: (Optional) Spezifiziert Dateien zum Einschließen mit fast-glob-Mustern. Mehrere Muster können durch Kommas getrennt werden (z.B. "**/*.{js,ts}", "src/**,docs/**"). Nur übereinstimmende Dateien werden verarbeitet.
- `ignorePatterns`: (Optional) Spezifiziert zusätzliche Dateien zum Ausschließen mit fast-glob-Mustern. Mehrere Muster können durch Kommas getrennt werden (z.B. "test/**,*.spec.js", "node_modules/**,dist/**"). Diese Muster ergänzen .gitignore und eingebaute Ausschlüsse.
- `topFilesLength`: (Optional, Standard: 10) Anzahl der größten Dateien nach Größe, die in der Metrik-Zusammenfassung für die Codebase-Analyse angezeigt werden.

**Beispiel:**
```json
{
  "directory": "/path/to/your/project",
  "compress": false,
  "includePatterns": "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md",
  "ignorePatterns": "**/*.log,tmp/",
  "topFilesLength": 10
}
```

### pack_remote_repository

Dieses Tool holt, klont und verpackt ein GitHub-Repository in eine XML-Datei für die KI-Analyse. Es klont automatisch das entfernte Repository, analysiert seine Struktur und generiert einen umfassenden Bericht.

**Parameter:**
- `remote`: (Erforderlich) GitHub-Repository-URL oder user/repo-Format (z.B. "yamadashy/repomix", "https://github.com/user/repo", oder "https://github.com/user/repo/tree/branch")
- `compress`: (Optional, Standard: false) Aktiviert Tree-sitter-Komprimierung zur Extraktion wesentlicher Code-Signaturen und -Strukturen bei gleichzeitiger Entfernung von Implementierungsdetails. Reduziert die Token-Nutzung um ~70% bei Beibehaltung der semantischen Bedeutung. Normalerweise nicht erforderlich, da grep_repomix_output inkrementelle Inhaltsabrufung ermöglicht. Verwenden Sie dies nur, wenn Sie speziell den gesamten Codebase-Inhalt für große Repositories benötigen.
- `includePatterns`: (Optional) Spezifiziert Dateien zum Einschließen mit fast-glob-Mustern. Mehrere Muster können durch Kommas getrennt werden (z.B. "**/*.{js,ts}", "src/**,docs/**"). Nur übereinstimmende Dateien werden verarbeitet.
- `ignorePatterns`: (Optional) Spezifiziert zusätzliche Dateien zum Ausschließen mit fast-glob-Mustern. Mehrere Muster können durch Kommas getrennt werden (z.B. "test/**,*.spec.js", "node_modules/**,dist/**"). Diese Muster ergänzen .gitignore und eingebaute Ausschlüsse.
- `topFilesLength`: (Optional, Standard: 10) Anzahl der größten Dateien nach Größe, die in der Metrik-Zusammenfassung für die Codebase-Analyse angezeigt werden.

**Beispiel:**
```json
{
  "remote": "yamadashy/repomix",
  "compress": false,
  "includePatterns": "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md",
  "ignorePatterns": "**/*.log,tmp/",
  "topFilesLength": 10
}
```

### read_repomix_output

Dieses Tool liest den Inhalt einer von Repomix generierten Ausgabedatei. Es unterstützt partielles Lesen mit Zeilenbereichen für große Dateien. Dieses Tool ist für Umgebungen konzipiert, in denen der direkte Dateisystemzugriff eingeschränkt ist.

**Parameter:**
- `outputId`: (Erforderlich) ID der zu lesenden Repomix-Ausgabedatei
- `startLine`: (Optional) Startzeilennummer (1-basiert, inklusive). Wenn nicht angegeben, wird vom Anfang gelesen.
- `endLine`: (Optional) Endzeilennummer (1-basiert, inklusive). Wenn nicht angegeben, wird bis zum Ende gelesen.

**Funktionen:**
- Speziell für webbasierte Umgebungen oder Sandbox-Anwendungen entwickelt
- Ruft den Inhalt zuvor generierter Ausgaben über ihre ID ab
- Bietet sicheren Zugriff auf verpackte Codebase ohne Dateisystemzugriff
- Unterstützt partielles Lesen für große Dateien

**Beispiel:**
```json
{
  "outputId": "8f7d3b1e2a9c6054",
  "startLine": 100,
  "endLine": 200
}
```

### grep_repomix_output

Dieses Tool durchsucht Muster in einer Repomix-Ausgabedatei mit grep-ähnlicher Funktionalität unter Verwendung der JavaScript RegExp-Syntax. Es gibt übereinstimmende Zeilen mit optionalen Kontextzeilen um die Übereinstimmungen zurück.

**Parameter:**
- `outputId`: (Erforderlich) ID der zu durchsuchenden Repomix-Ausgabedatei
- `pattern`: (Erforderlich) Suchmuster (JavaScript RegExp-Syntax für reguläre Ausdrücke)
- `contextLines`: (Optional, Standard: 0) Anzahl der Kontextzeilen, die vor und nach jeder Übereinstimmung angezeigt werden. Wird von beforeLines/afterLines überschrieben, wenn angegeben.
- `beforeLines`: (Optional) Anzahl der Kontextzeilen, die vor jeder Übereinstimmung angezeigt werden (wie grep -B). Hat Vorrang vor contextLines.
- `afterLines`: (Optional) Anzahl der Kontextzeilen, die nach jeder Übereinstimmung angezeigt werden (wie grep -A). Hat Vorrang vor contextLines.
- `ignoreCase`: (Optional, Standard: false) Führt groß-/kleinschreibungsunabhängige Übereinstimmung durch

**Funktionen:**
- Verwendet JavaScript RegExp-Syntax für leistungsstarke Musterübereinstimmung
- Unterstützt Kontextzeilen für besseres Verständnis der Übereinstimmungen
- Ermöglicht separate Kontrolle von Vor-/Nach-Kontextzeilen
- Groß-/kleinschreibungsabhängige und -unabhängige Suchoptionen

**Beispiel:**
```json
{
  "outputId": "8f7d3b1e2a9c6054",
  "pattern": "function\\s+\\w+\\(",
  "contextLines": 3,
  "ignoreCase": false
}
```

### file_system_read_file und file_system_read_directory

Der Repomix MCP-Server bietet zwei Dateisystemwerkzeuge, die es KI-Assistenten ermöglichen, sicher mit dem lokalen Dateisystem zu interagieren:

1. `file_system_read_file`
  - Liest Dateiinhalte aus dem lokalen Dateisystem unter Verwendung absoluter Pfade
  - Beinhaltet eingebaute Sicherheitsvalidierung zur Erkennung und Verhinderung des Zugriffs auf Dateien mit sensiblen Informationen
  - Implementiert Sicherheitsvalidierung mit [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint)
  - Verhindert den Zugriff auf Dateien mit sensiblen Informationen (API-Schlüssel, Passwörter, Geheimnisse)
  - Validiert absolute Pfade zur Verhinderung von Directory Traversal-Angriffen
  - Liefert klare Fehlermeldungen für ungültige Pfade und Sicherheitsprobleme

2. `file_system_read_directory`
  - Listet den Inhalt eines Verzeichnisses unter Verwendung eines absoluten Pfads
  - Gibt eine formatierte Liste zurück, die Dateien und Unterverzeichnisse mit klaren Indikatoren zeigt
  - Zeigt Dateien und Verzeichnisse mit klaren Indikatoren (`[FILE]` oder `[DIR]`)
  - Bietet sichere Verzeichnisnavigation mit angemessener Fehlerbehandlung
  - Validiert Pfade und stellt sicher, dass sie absolut sind
  - Nützlich für die Erkundung der Projektstruktur und das Verständnis der Codebase-Organisation

Beide Werkzeuge beinhalten robuste Sicherheitsmaßnahmen:
- Validierung absoluter Pfade zur Verhinderung von Directory Traversal-Angriffen
- Berechtigungsprüfungen zur Gewährleistung angemessener Zugriffsrechte
- Integration mit Secretlint zur Erkennung sensibler Informationen
- Klare Fehlermeldungen für Debugging und Sicherheitsbewusstsein

**Beispiel:**
```typescript
// Datei lesen
const fileContent = await tools.file_system_read_file({
  path: '/absolute/path/to/file.txt'
});

// Verzeichnisinhalt auflisten
const dirContent = await tools.file_system_read_directory({
  path: '/absolute/path/to/directory'
});
```

Diese Werkzeuge sind besonders nützlich, wenn KI-Assistenten:
- Bestimmte Dateien in der Codebase analysieren müssen
- Verzeichnisstrukturen navigieren müssen
- Existenz und Zugänglichkeit von Dateien überprüfen müssen
- Sichere Dateisystemoperationen gewährleisten müssen

## Vorteile der Verwendung von Repomix als MCP-Server

Die Verwendung von Repomix als MCP-Server bietet mehrere Vorteile:

1. **Direkte Integration**: KI-Assistenten können Ihre Codebasis ohne manuelle Dateivorbereitung direkt analysieren.
2. **Effizienter Workflow**: Optimiert den Prozess der Codeanalyse, indem die Notwendigkeit entfällt, Dateien manuell zu generieren und hochzuladen.
3. **Konsistente Ausgabe**: Stellt sicher, dass der KI-Assistent die Codebasis in einem konsistenten, optimierten Format erhält.
4. **Erweiterte Funktionen**: Nutzt alle Funktionen von Repomix wie Code-Komprimierung, Token-Zählung und Sicherheitsprüfungen.

Nach der Konfiguration kann Ihr KI-Assistent die Funktionen von Repomix direkt nutzen, um Codebasen zu analysieren, was Codeanalyse-Workflows effizienter macht.

# Ausgabeformate

Repomix unterstützt vier Ausgabeformate:
- XML (Standard)
- Markdown
- JSON
- Klartext

## XML-Format

```bash
repomix --style xml
```

Das XML-Format ist für die KI-Verarbeitung optimiert:

```xml
Diese Datei ist eine zusammengeführte Darstellung der gesamten Codebasis...

<file_summary>
(Metadaten und KI-Anweisungen)
</file_summary>

<directory_structure>
src/
  index.ts
  utils/

### Warum XML als Standardformat?

Repomix verwendet XML als Standard-Ausgabeformat basierend auf umfangreichen Forschungen und Tests. Diese Entscheidung gründet auf empirischen Belegen und praktischen Überlegungen für KI-unterstützte Codeanalyse.

Unsere Wahl von XML wird hauptsächlich von offiziellen Empfehlungen großer KI-Anbieter beeinflusst:
- **Anthropic (Claude)**: Empfiehlt explizit die Verwendung von XML-Tags zur Strukturierung von Prompts und erklärt, dass "Claude während des Trainings solchen Prompts ausgesetzt war" ([Dokumentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/use-xml-tags))
- **Google (Gemini)**: Empfiehlt strukturierte Formate einschließlich XML für komplexe Aufgaben ([Dokumentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/structure-prompts))
- **OpenAI (GPT)**: Befürwortet strukturiertes Prompting in komplexen Szenarien ([Ankündigung](https://x.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1890147300493914437), [Cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5_prompting_guide))

## Markdown-Format

```bash
repomix --style markdown
```

Markdown bietet lesbare Formatierung:

````markdown

```` 

## JSON-Format

```bash
repomix --style json
```

Das JSON-Format bietet strukturierte, programmatisch zugängliche Ausgabe mit camelCase-Eigenschaftsnamen:

```json
{
  "fileSummary": {
    "generationHeader": "Diese Datei ist eine zusammengeführte Darstellung der gesamten Codebasis, die von Repomix in ein einziges Dokument kombiniert wurde.",
    "purpose": "Diese Datei enthält eine gepackte Darstellung des gesamten Repository-Inhalts...",
    "fileFormat": "Der Inhalt ist wie folgt organisiert...",
    "usageGuidelines": "- Diese Datei sollte als schreibgeschützt behandelt werden...",
    "notes": "- Einige Dateien wurden möglicherweise aufgrund von .gitignore-Regeln ausgeschlossen..."
  },
  "userProvidedHeader": "Benutzerdefinierter Header-Text falls angegeben",
  "directoryStructure": "src/
  cli/
    cliOutput.ts
    index.ts
  config/
    configLoader.ts",
  "files": {
    "src/index.js": "// Dateiinhalt hier",
    "src/utils.js": "// Dateiinhalt hier"
  },
  "instruction": "Benutzerdefinierte Anweisungen aus instructionFilePath"
}
```

### Vorteile des JSON-Formats

Das JSON-Format ist ideal für:
- **Programmatische Verarbeitung**: Einfaches Parsen und Manipulieren mit JSON-Bibliotheken in jeder Programmiersprache
- **API-Integration**: Direkte Nutzung durch Webdienste und Anwendungen
- **KI-Tool-Kompatibilität**: Strukturiertes Format optimiert für maschinelles Lernen und KI-Systeme
- **Datenanalyse**: Unkomplizierte Extraktion spezifischer Informationen mit Tools wie `jq`

### Arbeiten mit JSON-Ausgabe mit `jq`

Das JSON-Format macht es einfach, spezifische Informationen programmatisch zu extrahieren. Hier sind häufige Beispiele:

#### Grundlegende Dateioperationen
```bash
# Alle Dateipfade auflisten
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[]'

# Gesamtanzahl der Dateien zählen
cat repomix-output.json | jq '.files | keys | length'

# Spezifischen Dateiinhalt extrahieren
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files["README.md"]'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files["src/index.js"]'
```

#### Dateifilterung und -analyse
```bash
# Dateien nach Erweiterung finden
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(endswith(".ts"))'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(endswith(".js") or endswith(".ts"))'

# Dateien mit spezifischem Text finden
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | select(.value | contains("function")) | .key'

# Dateiliste mit Zeichenzählung erstellen
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | "\(.key): \(.value | length) Zeichen"'
```

#### Metadaten-Extraktion
```bash
# Verzeichnisstruktur extrahieren
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.directoryStructure'

# Dateizusammenfassungsinformationen abrufen
cat repomix-output.json | jq '.fileSummary.purpose'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.fileSummary.generationHeader'

# Benutzerdefinierte Header extrahieren (falls vorhanden)
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.userProvidedHeader // "Kein Header angegeben"'

# Benutzerdefinierte Anweisungen abrufen
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.instruction // "Keine Anweisungen angegeben"'
```

#### Erweiterte Analyse
```bash
# Größte Dateien nach Inhaltslänge finden
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | [.key, (.value | length)] | @tsv' | sort -k2 -nr | head -10

# Nach Dateien mit spezifischen Mustern suchen
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | select(.value | test("import.*react"; "i")) | .key'

# Dateipfade mit mehreren Erweiterungen extrahieren
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(test("\.(js|ts|jsx|tsx)$"))'
```

## Klartext-Format

```bash
repomix --style plain
```

`````

## File: website/client/src/de/guide/security.md
`````markdown
# Sicherheit

## Sicherheitsprüfungsfunktion

Repomix verwendet [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint) zur Erkennung sensibler Informationen in Ihren Dateien:
- API-Schlüssel
- Zugangstoken
- Anmeldedaten
- Private Schlüssel
- Umgebungsvariablen

## Konfiguration

Sicherheitsprüfungen sind standardmäßig aktiviert.

Deaktivierung über CLI:
```bash
repomix --no-security-check
```

Oder in `repomix.config.json`:
```json
{
  "security": {
    "enableSecurityCheck": false
  }
}
```

## Sicherheitsmaßnahmen

1. **Binärdateiverarbeitung**: Binärdateiinhalte werden von der Ausgabe ausgeschlossen, aber ihre Pfade werden in der Verzeichnisstruktur für eine vollständige Repository-Übersicht aufgelistet
2. **Git-bewusst**: Berücksichtigt `.gitignore`-Muster
3. **Automatische Erkennung**: Sucht nach häufigen Sicherheitsproblemen:
  - AWS-Anmeldedaten
  - Datenbankverbindungszeichenfolgen
  - Authentifizierungstoken
  - Private Schlüssel

## Wenn die Sicherheitsprüfung Probleme findet

Beispielausgabe:
```bash
🔍 Sicherheitsprüfung:
──────────────────
2 verdächtige Datei(en) erkannt und ausgeschlossen:
1. config/credentials.json
  - AWS-Zugriffsschlüssel gefunden
2. .env.local
  - Datenbank-Passwort gefunden
```

## Best Practices

1. Überprüfen Sie die Ausgabe immer vor dem Teilen
2. Verwenden Sie `.repomixignore` für sensible Pfade
3. Lassen Sie Sicherheitsprüfungen aktiviert
4. Entfernen Sie sensible Dateien aus dem Repository

## Melden von Sicherheitsproblemen

Haben Sie eine Sicherheitslücke gefunden? Bitte:
1. Öffnen Sie kein öffentliches Issue
2. E-Mail: koukun0120@gmail.com
3. Oder nutzen Sie [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/security/advisories/new)

grep -l "TODO" **/*.ts | repomix --stdin

# Mit ripgrep zum Finden von Dateien mit bestimmten Inhalten
rg -l "TODO|FIXME" --type ts | repomix --stdin

# Mit sharkdp/fd zum Finden von Dateien
fd -e ts | repomix --stdin

# Mit fzf aus allen Dateien auswählen
fzf -m | repomix --stdin

# Interaktive Dateiauswahl mit fzf
find . -name "*.ts" -type f | fzf -m | repomix --stdin

# Mit ls und Glob-Mustern
ls src/**/*.ts | repomix --stdin

# Aus einer Datei mit Dateipfaden
cat file-list.txt | repomix --stdin

# Direkte Eingabe mit echo
echo -e "src/index.ts\nsrc/utils.ts" | repomix --stdin
```

Die `--stdin`-Option ermöglicht es Ihnen, eine Liste von Dateipfaden an Repomix zu übertragen und bietet ultimative Flexibilität bei der Auswahl der zu packenden Dateien.

Bei der Verwendung von `--stdin` werden die angegebenen Dateien effektiv zu den Include-Mustern hinzugefügt. Das bedeutet, dass das normale Include- und Ignore-Verhalten weiterhin gilt - über stdin angegebene Dateien werden trotzdem ausgeschlossen, wenn sie mit Ignore-Mustern übereinstimmen.

> [!NOTE]
> Bei der Verwendung von `--stdin` können Dateipfade relativ oder absolut angegeben werden, und Repomix übernimmt automatisch die Pfadauflösung und Deduplizierung.

### Code-Komprimierung

```bash
repomix --compress

# Sie können es auch mit Remote-Repositories verwenden:
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix --compress
```

### Git-Integration

Git-Informationen einschließen, um Entwicklungskontext für KI-Analysen bereitzustellen:

```bash
# Git-Diffs einschließen (ungespeicherte Änderungen)
repomix --include-diffs

# Git-Commit-Logs einschließen (standardmäßig die letzten 50 Commits)
repomix --include-logs

# Bestimmte Anzahl von Commits einschließen
repomix --include-logs --include-logs-count 10

# Sowohl Diffs als auch Logs einschließen
repomix --include-diffs --include-logs
```

Dies fügt wertvollen Kontext hinzu über:
- **Letzte Änderungen**: Git-Diffs zeigen ungespeicherte Modifikationen
- **Entwicklungsmuster**: Git-Logs zeigen, welche Dateien typischerweise zusammen geändert werden
- **Commit-Historie**: Aktuelle Commit-Nachrichten geben Einblick in den Entwicklungsfokus
- **Dateibeziehungen**: Verstehen, welche Dateien in denselben Commits modifiziert werden

### Token-Anzahl-Optimierung

Das Verständnis der Token-Verteilung Ihrer Codebasis ist entscheidend für die Optimierung von KI-Interaktionen. Verwenden Sie die `--token-count-tree`-Option, um die Token-Nutzung in Ihrem gesamten Projekt zu visualisieren:

```bash
repomix --token-count-tree
```

Dies zeigt eine hierarchische Ansicht Ihrer Codebasis mit Token-Anzahlen:

```
🔢 Token Count Tree:
────────────────────
└── src/ (70,925 tokens)
    ├── cli/ (12,714 tokens)
    │   ├── actions/ (7,546 tokens)
    │   └── reporters/ (990 tokens)
    └── core/ (41,600 tokens)
        ├── file/ (10,098 tokens)
        └── output/ (5,808 tokens)
```

Sie können auch eine minimale Token-Schwelle setzen, um sich auf größere Dateien zu konzentrieren:

```bash
repomix --token-count-tree 1000  # Nur Dateien/Verzeichnisse mit 1000+ Tokens anzeigen
```

Dies hilft Ihnen dabei:
- **Token-schwere Dateien identifizieren** - Dateien, die KI-Kontextlimits überschreiten könnten
- **Dateiauswahl optimieren** - Verwendung von `--include` und `--ignore` Mustern
- **Komprimierungsstrategien planen** - Zielgerichtete Strategien für die größten Beitragenden
- **Inhalte vs. Kontext ausbalancieren** - Beim Vorbereiten von Code für KI-Analysen

## Warum Repomix?

Repomix zeichnet sich durch seine Fähigkeit aus, mit Abonnement-Services wie ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok zu arbeiten, ohne sich um Kosten sorgen zu müssen, während es einen vollständigen Codebase-Kontext bereitstellt, der die Notwendigkeit zur Dateierkundung eliminiert – was die Analyse schneller und oft genauer macht.

Mit der gesamten Codebase als verfügbarem Kontext ermöglicht Repomix eine breite Palette von Anwendungen, einschließlich Implementierungsplanung, Fehleruntersuchung, Sicherheitsprüfungen von Drittanbieter-Bibliotheken, Dokumentationsgenerierung und vieles mehr.

## Verwendung des CLI-Tools {#using-the-cli-tool}

Repomix kann als Kommandozeilen-Tool verwendet werden und bietet leistungsstarke Funktionen und Anpassungsoptionen.

**Das CLI-Tool kann auf private Repositories zugreifen**, da es Ihr lokal installiertes Git verwendet.

### Schnellstart

Sie können Repomix sofort in Ihrem Projektverzeichnis ohne Installation ausprobieren:

```bash
npx repomix@latest
```

Oder installieren Sie es global für wiederholte Verwendung:

```bash
# Installation mit npm
npm install -g repomix

# Alternativ mit yarn
yarn global add repomix

# Alternativ mit bun
bun add -g repomix

# Alternativ mit Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
brew install repomix

# Dann in einem beliebigen Projektverzeichnis ausführen
repomix
```

Das war's! Repomix generiert eine `repomix-output.xml` Datei in Ihrem aktuellen Verzeichnis, die Ihr gesamtes Repository in einem KI-freundlichen Format enthält.

### Verwendung

Um Ihr gesamtes Repository zu packen:

```bash
repomix
```

Um ein bestimmtes Verzeichnis zu packen:

```bash
repomix path/to/directory
```

Um bestimmte Dateien oder Verzeichnisse mit [Glob-Mustern](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax) zu packen:

```bash
repomix --include "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md"
```

Um bestimmte Dateien oder Verzeichnisse auszuschließen:

```bash
repomix --ignore "**/*.log,tmp/"
```

Um ein Remote-Repository zu packen:
```bash
# Kurzform verwenden
npx repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix

# Vollständige URL verwenden (unterstützt Branches und spezifische Pfade)
npx repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix
npx repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/tree/main

# Commit-URL verwenden
npx repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/commit/836...
```

Um eine neue Konfigurationsdatei (`repomix.config.json`) zu initialisieren:

```bash
repomix --init
```

Sobald Sie die gepackte Datei erstellt haben, können Sie sie mit generativen KI-Tools wie Claude, ChatGPT und Gemini verwenden.

#### Docker-Verwendung

Sie können Repomix auch mit Docker ausführen 🐳  
Dies ist nützlich, wenn Sie Repomix in einer isolierten Umgebung ausführen oder Container bevorzugen.

Grundlegende Verwendung (aktuelles Verzeichnis):

```bash
docker run -v .:/app -it --rm ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix
```

Um ein bestimmtes Verzeichnis zu packen:
```bash
docker run -v .:/app -it --rm ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix path/to/directory
```

Ein Remote-Repository verarbeiten und in ein `output`-Verzeichnis ausgeben:

```bash
docker run -v ./output:/app -it --rm ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix
```

### Ausgabeformate

# Using Repomix as a Library

In addition to using Repomix as a CLI tool, you can integrate its functionality directly into your Node.js applications.

## Installation

Install Repomix as a dependency in your project:

```bash
npm install repomix
```

## Basic Usage

The simplest way to use Repomix is through the `runCli` function, which provides the same functionality as the command-line interface:

```javascript
import { runCli, type CliOptions } from 'repomix';

// Process current directory with custom options
async function packProject() {
  const options = {
    output: 'output.xml',
    style: 'xml',
    compress: true,
    quiet: true
  } as CliOptions;
  
  const result = await runCli(['.'], process.cwd(), options);
  return result.packResult;
}
```

The `result.packResult` contains information about the processed files, including:
- `totalFiles`: Number of files processed
- `totalCharacters`: Total character count
- `totalTokens`: Total token count (useful for LLM context limits)
- `fileCharCounts`: Character counts per file
- `fileTokenCounts`: Token counts per file

## Processing Remote Repositories

You can clone and process a remote repository:

```javascript
import { runCli, type CliOptions } from 'repomix';

// Clone and process a GitHub repo
async function processRemoteRepo(repoUrl) {
  const options = {
    remote: repoUrl,
    output: 'output.xml',
    compress: true
  } as CliOptions;
  
  return await runCli(['.'], process.cwd(), options);
}
```

## Using Core Components

For more control, you can use Repomix's low-level APIs directly:

```javascript
import { searchFiles, collectFiles, processFiles, TokenCounter } from 'repomix';

async function analyzeFiles(directory) {
  // Find and collect files
  const { filePaths } = await searchFiles(directory, { /* config */ });
  const rawFiles = await collectFiles(filePaths, directory);
  const processedFiles = await processFiles(rawFiles, { /* config */ });
  
  // Count tokens
  const tokenCounter = new TokenCounter('o200k_base');
  
  // Return analysis results
  return processedFiles.map(file => ({
    path: file.path,
    tokens: tokenCounter.countTokens(file.content)
  }));
}
```

## Real-World Example

The Repomix website ([repomix.com](https://repomix.com)) uses Repomix as a library to process remote repositories. You can see the implementation in [website/server/src/remoteRepo.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/....ts).

# AI-Assisted Development Best Practices: From My Experience

While I haven't successfully completed a large-scale project using AI yet, I'd like to share what I've learned so far from my experience working with AI in development.

## Basic Development Approach

When working with AI, attempting to implement all features at once can lead to unexpected issues and project stagnation. That's why it's more effective to start with core functionality and build each feature one at a time, ensuring solid implementation before moving forward.

### The Power of Existing Code

This approach is effective because implementing core functionality allows you to materialize your ideal design and coding style through actual code. The most effective way to communicate your project vision is through code that reflects your standards and preferences.

By starting with core features and ensuring each component works properly before moving on, the entire project maintains consistency, making it easier for AI to generate more appropriate code.

## The Modular Approach

Breaking code into smaller modules is crucial. In my experience, keeping files around 250 lines of code makes it easier to give clear instructions to AI and makes the trial-and-error process more efficient. While token count would be a more accurate metric, line count is more practical for human developers to work with, so we use that as a guideline.

This modularization isn't just about separating frontend, backend, and database components - it's about breaking down functionality at a much finer level. For example, within a single feature, you might separate validation, error handling, and other specific functionalities into distinct modules. Of course, high-level separation is also important, and implementing this modular approach gradually helps maintain clear instructions and enables AI to generate more appropriate code. This approach is effective not just for AI but for human developers as well.

## Ensuring Quality Through Testing

I consider testing to be crucial in AI-assisted development. Tests serve not only as quality assurance measures but also as documentation that clearly demonstrates code intentions. When asking AI to implement new features, existing test code effectively acts as a specification document.

Tests are also an excellent tool for validating the correctness of AI-generated code. For instance, when having AI implement new functionality for a module, writing test cases beforehand allows you to objectively evaluate whether the generated code behaves as expected. This aligns well with Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles and is particularly effective when collaborating with AI.

## Balancing Planning and Implementation

Before implementing large-scale features, I recommend first discussing the plan with AI. Organizing requirements and considering architecture leads to smoother implementation. A good practice is to compile requirements first, then move to a separate chat session for implementation work.

It's essential to have human review of AI output and make adjustments as needed. While the quality of AI-generated code is generally moderate, it still accelerates development compared to writing everything from scratch.

## Conclusion

By following these practices, you can leverage AI's strengths while building a consistent, high-quality codebase. Even as your project grows in size, each component remains well-defined and manageable.

# Agent Skills Generation

Repomix can generate [Claude Agent Skills](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) format output, creating a structured Skills directory that can be used as a reusable codebase reference for AI assistants.

This feature is particularly powerful when you want to reference implementations from remote repositories. By generating Skills from open source projects, you can easily ask Claude to reference specific patterns or implementations while working on your own code.

Instead of generating a single packed file, Skills generation creates a structured directory with multiple reference files optimized for AI comprehension and grep-friendly searching.

> [!NOTE]
> This is an experimental feature. The output format and options may change in future releases based on user feedback.

## Basic Usage

Generate Skills from your local directory:

```bash
# Generate Skills from current directory
repomix --skill-generate

# Generate with custom Skills name
repomix --skill-generate my-project-reference

# Generate from specific directory
repomix path/to/directory --skill-generate

# Generate from remote repository
repomix --remote https://github.com/user/repo --skill-generate
```

## Skills Location Selection

When you run the command, Repomix prompts you to choose where to save the Skills:

1. **Personal Skills** (`~/.claude/skills/`) - Available across all projects on your machine
2. **Project Skills** (`.claude/skills/`) - Shared with your team via git

If the Skills directory already exists, you'll be prompted to confirm overwriting it.

> [!TIP]
> When generating Project Skills, consider adding them to `.gitignore` to avoid committing large files:
> ```gitignore
> .claude/skills/repomix-reference-*/
> ```

## Generated Structure

The Skills are generated with the following structure:

```text
.claude/skills/<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md                    # Main Skills metadata & documentation
└── references/
    ├── summary.md              # Purpose, format, and statistics
    ├── project-structure.md    # Directory tree with line counts
    ├── files.md                # All file contents (grep-friendly)
    └── tech-stack.md           # Languages, frameworks, dependencies
```

### File Descriptions

#### SKILL.md

The main Skills file containing:
- Skills name, description, and project info
- File count, line count, and token count
- Overview of how to use the Skills
- File locations and format explanation
- Common use cases and tips

#### references/summary.md

Contains:
- **Purpose**: Explains this is a reference codebase for AI consumption
- **File Structure**: Documents what's in each reference file
- **Usage Guidelines**: How to use the Skills effectively
- **Statistics**: Breakdown by file type, language, and largest files

#### references/project-structure.md

Directory tree with line counts per file for easy file discovery:

```text
src/
  index.ts (42 lines)
  utils/
    helpers.ts (128 lines)
    math.ts (87 lines)
```

#### references/files.md

All file contents with syntax highlighting headers, optimized for grep-friendly searching:

````markdown
## File: src/index.ts
```typescript
import { sum } from './utils/helpers';

export function main() {
  console.log(sum(1, 2));
}
```
````

#### references/tech-stack.md

Auto-detected tech stack from dependency files:
- **Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, etc.
- **Frameworks**: React, Next.js, Express, Django, etc.
- **Runtime Versions**: Node.js, Python, Go, etc.
- **Package Manager**: npm, pnpm, poetry, etc.
- **Dependencies**: All direct and dev dependencies
- **Config Files**: All detected configuration files

Detected from files like: `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `.nvmrc`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.

## Auto-Generated Skills Names

If no name is provided, Repomix auto-generates one using this pattern:

```bash
repomix src/ --skill-generate                # → repomix-reference-src
repomix --remote user/repo --skill-generate  # → repomix-reference-repo
repomix --skill-generate CustomName          # → custom-name (normalized to kebab-case)
```

Skills names are:
- Converted to kebab-case (lowercase, hyphen-separated)
- Limited to 64 characters maximum
- Protected against path traversal

## Integration with Repomix Options

Skills generation respects all standard Repomix options:

```bash
# Generate Skills with file filtering
repomix --skill-generate --include "src/**/*.ts" --ignore "**/*.test.ts"

# Generate Skills with compression
repomix --skill-generate --compress

# Generate Skills from remote repository
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix --skill-generate

# Generate Skills with specific output format options
repomix --skill-generate --remove-comments --remove-empty-lines
```

### Documentation-Only Skills

Using `--include`, you can generate Skills containing only the documentation from a GitHub repository. This is useful when you want Claude to reference specific library or framework documentation while working on your code:

```bash
# Claude Code Action documentation
repomix --remote https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action --include docs --skill-generate

# Vite documentation
repomix --remote https://github.com/vitejs/vite --include docs --skill-generate

# React documentation
repomix --remote https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev --include src/content --skill-generate
```

## Limitations

The `--skill-generate` option cannot be used with:
- `--stdout` - Skills output requires writing to filesystem
- `--copy` - Skills output is a directory, not copyable to clipboard

## Using Generated Skills

Once generated, you can use the Skills with Claude:

1. **Claude Code**: The Skills are automatically available if saved to `~/.claude/skills/` or `.claude/skills/`
2. **Claude Web**: Upload the Skills directory to Claude for codebase analysis
3. **Team Sharing**: Commit `.claude/skills/` to your repository for team-wide access

## Example Workflow

### Creating a Personal Reference Library

```bash
# Clone and analyze an interesting open source project
repomix --remote facebook/react --skill-generate react-reference

# The Skills are saved to ~/.claude/skills/react-reference/
# Now you can reference React's codebase in any Claude conversation
```

### Team Project Documentation

```bash
# In your project directory
cd my-project

# Generate Skills for your team
repomix --skill-generate

# Choose "Project Skills" when prompted
# The Skills are saved to .claude/skills/repomix-reference-my-project/

# Commit and share with your team
git add .claude/skills/
git commit -m "Add codebase reference Skills"
```

`````markdown
# Code Compression

Code compression is a powerful feature that intelligently extracts essential code structures while removing implementation details. This is particularly useful for reducing token count while maintaining important structural information about your codebase.

> [!NOTE]  
> This is an experimental feature that we'll be actively improving based on user feedback and real-world usage

## Basic Usage

Enable code compression using the `--compress` flag:

```bash
repomix --compress
```

You can also use it with remote repositories:

```bash
repomix --remote user/repo --compress
```

## How It Works

The compression algorithm processes code using tree-sitter parsing to extract and preserve essential structural elements while removing implementation details.

The compression preserves:
- Function and method signatures
- Interface and type definitions
- Class structures and properties
- Important structural elements

While removing:
- Function and method implementations
- Loop and conditional logic details
- Internal variable declarations
- Implementation-specific code

### Example

Original TypeScript code:

```typescript
import { ShoppingItem } from './shopping-item';

/**
 * Calculate the total price of shopping items
 */
const calculateTotal = (
  items: ShoppingItem[]
) => {
  let total = 0;
  for (const item of items) {
    total += item.price * item.quantity;
  }
  return total;
}

// Shopping item interface
interface Item {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  quantity: number;
}
```

After compression:

```typescript
import { ShoppingItem } from './shopping-item';
⋮----
/**
 * Calculate the total price of shopping items
 */
const calculateTotal = (
  items: ShoppingItem[]
) => {
⋮----
// Shopping item interface
interface Item {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  quantity: number;
}
```

## Configuration

You can enable compression in your configuration file:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "compress": true
  }
}
```

## Use Cases

Code compression is particularly useful when:
- Analyzing code structure and architecture
- Reducing token count for LLM processing
- Creating high-level documentation
- Understanding code patterns and signatures
- Sharing API and interface designs

## Related Options

You can combine compression with other options:
- `--remove-comments`: Remove code comments
- `--remove-empty-lines`: Remove empty lines

## File: website/client/src/en/guide/comment-removal.md
`````markdown
# Comment Removal

Repomix can automatically remove comments from your codebase when generating the output file. This can help reduce noise and focus on the actual code.

## Usage

To enable comment removal, set the `removeComments` option to `true` in your `repomix.config.json`:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "removeComments": true
  }
}
```

## Supported Languages

Repomix supports comment removal for a wide range of programming languages, including:

- JavaScript/TypeScript (`//`, `/* */`)
- Python (`#`, `"""`, `'''`)
- Java (`//`, `/* */`)
- C/C++ (`//`, `/* */`)
- HTML (`<!-- -->`)
- CSS (`/* */`)
- And many more...

## Example

Given the following JavaScript code:

```javascript
// This is a single-line comment
function test() {
  /* This is a
     multi-line comment */
  return true;
}
```

With comment removal enabled, the output will be:

```javascript
function test() {
  return true;
}
```

## Notes

- Comment removal is performed before other processing steps, such as line number addition.
- Some comments, such as JSDoc comments, may be preserved depending on the language and context.

## File: website/client/src/en/guide/configuration.md
`````markdown
# Configuration

Repomix can be configured using a configuration file or command-line options. The configuration file allows you to customize various aspects of how Repomix processes and outputs your codebase.

## Configuration File Formats

Repomix supports multiple configuration file formats for flexibility and ease of use.

Repomix will automatically search for configuration files in the following priority order:

1. **TypeScript** (`repomix.config.ts`, `repomix.config.mts`, `repomix.config.cts`)
2. **JavaScript/ES Module** (`repomix.config.js`, `repomix.config.mjs`, `repomix.config.cjs`)
3. **JSON** (`repomix.config.json5`, `repomix.config.jsonc`, `repomix.config.json`)

### JSON Configuration

Create a configuration file in your project directory:
```bash
repomix --init
```

This will create a `repomix.config.json` file with default settings. You can also create a global configuration file that will be used as a fallback when no local configuration is found:

```bash
repomix --init --global
```

### TypeScript Configuration

TypeScript configuration files provide the best developer experience with full type checking and IDE support.

**Installation:**

To use TypeScript or JavaScript configuration with `defineConfig`, you need to install Repomix as a dev dependency:

```bash
npm install -D repomix
```

**Example:**

```typescript
// repomix.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'repomix';

export default defineConfig({
  output: {
    filePath: 'output.xml',
    style: 'xml',
    removeComments: true,
  },
  ignore: {
    customPatterns: ['**/node_modules/**', '**/dist/**'],
  },
});
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Full TypeScript type checking in your IDE
- ✅ Excellent IDE autocomplete and IntelliSense
- ✅ Use dynamic values (timestamps, environment variables, etc.)

**Dynamic Values Example:**

```typescript
// repomix.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'repomix';

// Generate timestamp-based filename
const timestamp = new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 19).replace(/[:.]/g, '-');

export default defineConfig({
  output: {
    filePath: `output-${timestamp}.xml`,
    style: 'xml',
  },
});
```

### JavaScript Configuration

JavaScript configuration files work the same as TypeScript, supporting `defineConfig` and dynamic values.

The configuration file supports [JSON5](https://json5.org/) syntax, which allows:
- Comments (both single-line and multi-line)
- Trailing commas in objects and arrays
- Unquoted property names
- More relaxed string syntax

## Schema Validation

You can enable schema validation for your configuration file by adding the `$schema` property:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://repomix.com/schemas/latest/schema.json",
  "output": {
    "filePath": "repomix-output.xml",
    "style": "xml"
  }
}
```

This provides auto-completion and validation in editors that support JSON schema.

## Example Configuration File

Here's an example of a complete configuration file (`repomix.config.json`):

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://repomix.com/schemas/latest/schema.json",
  "input": {
    "maxFileSize": 50000000
  },
  "output": {
    "filePath": "repomix-output.xml",
    "style": "xml",
    "parsableStyle": false,
    "compress": false,
    "headerText": "Custom header information for the packed file.",
    "fileSummary": true,
    "directoryStructure": true,
    "files": true,
    "removeComments": false,
    "removeEmptyLines": false,
    "topFilesLength": 5,
    "showLineNumbers": false,
    "truncateBase64": false,
    "copyToClipboard": false,
    "includeEmptyDirectories": false,
    "git": {
      "sortByChanges": true,
      "sortByChangesMaxCommits": 100,
      "includeDiffs": false,
      "includeLogs": false,
      "includeLogsCount": 50
    }
  },
  "include": ["**/*"],
  "ignore": {
    "useGitignore": true,
    "useDefaultPatterns": true,
    // Patterns can also be specified in .repomixignore
    "customPatterns": [
      "additional-folder",
      "**/*.log"
    ],
  },
  "security": {
    "enableSecurityCheck": true
  },
  "tokenCount": {
    "encoding": "o200k_base"
  }
}
```

## Configuration File Locations

Repomix looks for configuration files in the following order:
1. Local configuration file in the current directory (priority order: TS > JS > JSON)
   - TypeScript: `repomix.config.ts`, `repomix.config.mts`, `repomix.config.cts`
   - JavaScript: `repomix.config.js`, `repomix.config.mjs`, `repomix.config.cjs`
   - JSON: `repomix.config.json5`, `repomix.config.jsonc`, `repomix.config.json`
2. Global configuration file (priority order: TS > JS > JSON)
   - Windows:
     - TypeScript: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.ts`, `.mts`, `.cts`
     - JavaScript: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`
     - JSON: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.json5`, `.jsonc`, `.json`
   - macOS/Linux:
     - TypeScript: `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.ts`, `.mts`, `.cts`
     - JavaScript: `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`
     - JSON: `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.json5`, `.jsonc`, `.json`

Command-line options take precedence over configuration file settings.

## Include Patterns

Repomix supports specifying files to include using [glob patterns](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax). This allows for more flexible and powerful file selection:

- Use `**/*.js` to include all JavaScript files in any directory
- Use `src/**/*` to include all files within the `src` directory and its subdirectories
- Combine multiple patterns like `["src/**/*.js", "**/*.md"]` to include JavaScript files in `src` and all Markdown files

You can specify include patterns in your configuration file:

```json
{
  "include": ["src/**/*", "tests/**/*.test.js"]
}
```

Or use the `--include` command-line option for one-time filtering.

## Ignore Patterns

Repomix offers multiple methods to set ignore patterns for excluding specific files or directories during the packing process:

- **.gitignore**: By default, patterns listed in your project's `.gitignore` files and `.git/info/exclude` are used. This behavior can be controlled with the `ignore.useGitignore` setting or the `--no-gitignore` CLI option.
- **.ignore**: You can use a `.ignore` file in your project root, following the same format as `.gitignore`. This file is respected by tools like ripgrep and the silver searcher, reducing the need to maintain multiple ignore files. This behavior can be controlled with the `ignore.useDotIgnore` setting or the `--no-dot-ignore` CLI option.
- **Default patterns**: Repomix includes a default list of commonly excluded files and directories (e.g., node_modules, .git, binary files). This feature can be controlled with the `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` setting or the `--no-default-patterns` CLI option. Please see [defaultIgnore.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/src/config/defaultIgnore.ts) for more details.
- **.repomixignore**: You can create a `.repomixignore` file in your project root to define Repomix-specific ignore patterns. This file follows the same format as `.gitignore`.
- **Custom patterns**: Additional ignore patterns can be specified using the `ignore.customPatterns` option in the configuration file. You can overwrite this setting with the `-i, --ignore` command line option.

**Priority Order** (from highest to lowest):

1. Custom patterns (`ignore.customPatterns`)
2. Ignore files (`.repomixignore`, `.ignore`, `.gitignore`, and `.git/info/exclude`):
   - When in nested directories, files in deeper directories have higher priority
   - When in the same directory, these files are merged in no particular order
3. Default patterns (if `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` is true and `--no-default-patterns` is not used)

This approach allows for flexible file exclusion configuration based on your project's needs. It helps optimize the size of the generated pack file by ensuring the exclusion of security-sensitive files and large binary files, while preventing the leakage of confidential information.

**Note:** Binary files are not included in the packed output by default, but their paths are listed in the "Repository Structure" section of the output file. This provides a complete overview of the repository structure while keeping the packed file efficient and text-based. See [Binary Files Handling](#binary-files-handling) for more details.

Example of `.repomixignore`:
```text
# Cache directories
.cache/
tmp/

# Build outputs
dist/
build/

# Logs
*.log
```

## Default Ignore Patterns

When `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` is true, Repomix automatically ignores common patterns:
```text
node_modules/**
.git/**
coverage/**
dist/**
```

For the complete list, see [defaultIgnore.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/src/config/defaultIgnore.ts)

## Binary Files Handling

Binary files (such as images, PDFs, compiled binaries, archives, etc.) are handled specially to maintain an efficient, text-based output:

- **File Contents**: Binary files are **not included** in the packed output to keep the file text-based and efficient for AI processing
- **Directory Structure**: Binary file **paths are listed** in the directory structure section, providing a complete overview of your repository

This approach ensures you get a complete view of your repository structure while maintaining an efficient, text-based output optimized for AI consumption.

**Example:**

If your repository contains `logo.png` and `app.jar`:
- They will appear in the Directory Structure section
- Their contents will not be included in the Files section

**Directory Structure Output:**
```
src/
  index.ts
  utils.ts
assets/
  logo.png
build/
  app.jar
```

This way, AI tools can understand that these binary files exist in your project structure without processing their binary contents.

**Note:** You can control the maximum file size threshold using the `input.maxFileSize` configuration option (default: 50MB). Files larger than this limit will be skipped entirely.

## Advanced Features

### Code Compression

The code compression feature, enabled with `output.compress: true`, uses [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) to intelligently extract essential code structures while removing implementation details. This helps reduce token count while maintaining important structural information.

Key benefits:
- Reduces token count significantly
- Preserves class and function signatures
- Maintains imports and exports
- Keeps type definitions and interfaces
- Removes function bodies and implementation details

For more details and examples, see the [Code Compression Guide](code-compress).

### Git Integration

The `output.git` configuration provides powerful Git-aware features:

- `sortByChanges`: When true, files are sorted by the number of Git changes (commits that modified the file). Files with more changes appear at the bottom of the output. This helps prioritize more actively developed files. Default: `true`
- `sortByChangesMaxCommits`: The maximum number of commits to analyze when counting file changes. Default: `100`
- `includeDiffs`: When true, includes Git differences in the output (includes both work tree and staged changes separately). This allows the reader to see pending changes in the repository. Default: `false`
- `includeLogs`: When true, includes Git commit history in the output. Shows commit dates, messages, and file paths for each commit. This helps AI understand development patterns and file relationships. Default: `false`
- `includeLogsCount`: The number of recent commits to include in the git logs. Default: `50`

Example configuration:
```json
{
  "output": {
    "git": {
      "sortByChanges": true,
      "sortByChangesMaxCommits": 100,
      "includeDiffs": true,
      "includeLogs": true,
      "includeLogsCount": 25
    }
  }
}
```

### Security Checks

When `security.enableSecurityCheck` is enabled, Repomix uses [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint) to detect sensitive information in your codebase before including it in the output. This helps prevent accidental exposure of:

- API keys
- Access tokens
- Private keys
- Passwords
- Other sensitive credentials

### Comment Removal

When `output.removeComments` is set to `true`, comments are removed from supported file types to reduce output size and focus on essential code content. This can be particularly useful when:

- Working with heavily documented code
- Trying to reduce token count
- Focusing on code structure and logic

For supported languages and detailed examples, see the [Comment Removal Guide](comment-removal).

## File: website/client/src/en/guide/custom-instructions.md
`````markdown
# Custom Instructions

Repomix allows you to provide custom instructions that will be included in the output file. This can be useful for adding context or specific guidelines for AI systems processing the repository.

## Usage

To include a custom instruction, create a markdown file (e.g., `repomix-instruction.md`) in the root of your repository. Then, specify the path to this file in your `repomix.config.json`:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "instructionFilePath": "repomix-instruction.md"
  }
}
```

The content of this file will be included in the output under the "Instruction" section.

## Example

```markdown
# Repository Instructions

This repository contains the source code for the Repomix tool. Please follow these guidelines when analyzing the code:

1. Focus on the core functionality in the `src/core` directory.
2. Pay special attention to the security checks in `src/core/security`.
3. Ignore any files in the `tests` directory.
```

This will result in the following section in the output:

```xml
<instruction>
# Repository Instructions

This repository contains the source code for the Repomix tool. Please follow these guidelines when analyzing the code:

1. Focus on the core functionality in the `src/core` directory.
2. Pay special attention to the security checks in `src/core/security`.
3. Ignore any files in the `tests` directory.
</instruction>

## Basic Usage

Add the following step to your workflow YAML to pack your repository:

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    output: repomix-output.xml
```

## Using Different Output Formats

You can specify different output formats using the `style` parameter (the default is `xml`):

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    output: repomix-output.md
    style: markdown
```

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix (JSON format)
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    output: repomix-output.json
    style: json
```

## Packing Multiple Directories with Compression

You can specify multiple directories, include/exclude patterns, and enable smart compression:

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main

# MCP Server

Repomix supports the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), allowing AI assistants to directly interact with your codebase. When run as an MCP server, Repomix provides tools that enable AI assistants to package local or remote repositories for analysis without requiring manual file preparation.

> [!NOTE]  
> This is an experimental feature that we'll be actively improving based on user feedback and real-world usage

## Running Repomix as an MCP Server

To run Repomix as an MCP server, use the `--mcp` flag:

```bash
repomix --mcp
```

This starts Repomix in MCP server mode, making it available for AI assistants that support the Model Context Protocol.

## Configuring MCP Servers

To use Repomix as an MCP server with AI assistants like Claude, you need to configure the MCP settings:

### For VS Code

You can install the Repomix MCP server in VS Code using one of these methods:

1. **Using the Install Badge:**

  [![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-VS_Code?style=flat-square&label=Install%20Server&color=0098FF)](vscode:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22repomix%22%2C%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22repomix%22%2C%22--mcp%22%5D%7D)<br>
  [![Install in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-VS_Code_Insiders?style=flat-square&label=Install%20Server&color=24bfa5)](vscode-insiders:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22repomix%22%2C%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22repomix%22%2C%22--mcp%22%5D%7D)

2. **Using the Command Line:**

  ```bash
  code --add-mcp '{"name":"repomix","command":"npx","args":["-y","repomix","--mcp"]}'
  ```

  For VS Code Insiders:
  ```bash
  code-insiders --add-mcp '{"name":"repomix","command":"npx","args":["-y","repomix","--mcp"]}'
  ```

### For Cline (VS Code extension)

Edit the `cline_mcp_settings.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "repomix": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "repomix",
        "--mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### For Cursor

In Cursor, add a new MCP server from `Cursor Settings` > `MCP` > `+ Add new global MCP server` with a configuration similar to Cline.

### For Claude Desktop

Edit the `claude_desktop_config.json` file with similar configuration to Cline's config.

### For Claude Code

Configure Repomix as an MCP server in [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview) using the following command:

```bash
claude mcp add repomix -- npx -y repomix --mcp
```

Alternatively, you can use the **official Repomix plugins** for a more convenient experience. The plugins provide natural language commands and easier setup. See the [Claude Code Plugins](/guide/claude-code-plugins) documentation for details.

### Using Docker instead of npx

Instead of using npx, you can also use Docker to run Repomix as an MCP server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "repomix-docker": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix",
        "--mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Available MCP Tools

When running as an MCP server, Repomix provides the following tools:

### pack_codebase

This tool packages a local code directory into a consolidated XML file for AI analysis. It analyzes the codebase structure, extracts relevant code content, and generates a comprehensive report including metrics, file tree, and formatted code content.

**Parameters:**
- `directory`: (Required) Absolute path to the directory to pack
- `compress`: (Optional, default: false) Enable Tree-sitter compression to extract essential code signatures and structure while removing implementation details. Reduces token usage by ~70% while preserving semantic meaning. Generally not needed since grep_repomix_output allows incremental content retrieval. Use only when you specifically need the entire codebase content for large repositories.
- `includePatterns`: (Optional) Specify files to include using fast-glob patterns. Multiple patterns can be comma-separated (e.g., "**/*.{js,ts}", "src/**,docs/**"). Only matching files will be processed.
- `ignorePatterns`: (Optional) Specify additional files to exclude using fast-glob patterns. Multiple patterns can be comma-separated (e.g., "test/**,*.spec.js", "node_modules/**,dist/**"). These patterns supplement .gitignore and built-in exclusions.
- `topFilesLength`: (Optional, default: 10) Number of largest files by size to display in the metrics summary for codebase analysis.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "directory": "/path/to/your/project",
  "compress": false,
  "includePatterns": "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md",
  "ignorePatterns": "**/*.log,tmp/",
  "topFilesLength": 10
}
```

### pack_remote_repository

This tool fetches, clones, and packages a GitHub repository into a consolidated XML file for AI analysis. It automatically clones the remote repository, analyzes its structure, and generates a comprehensive report.

**Parameters:**
- `remote`: (Required) GitHub repository URL or user/repo format (e.g., "yamadashy/repomix", "https://github.com/user/repo", or "https://github.com/user/repo/tree/branch")
- `compress`: (Optional, default: false) Enable Tree-sitter compression to extract essential code signatures and structure while removing implementation details. Reduces token usage by ~70% while preserving semantic meaning. Generally not needed since grep_repomix_output allows incremental content retrieval. Use only when you specifically need the entire codebase content for large repositories.
- `includePatterns`: (Optional) Specify files to include using fast-glob patterns. Multiple patterns can be comma-separated (e.g., "**/*.{js,ts}", "src/**,docs/**"). Only matching files will be processed.
- `ignorePatterns`: (Optional) Specify additional files to exclude using fast-glob patterns. Multiple patterns can be comma-separated (e.g., "test/**,*.spec.js", "node_modules/**,dist/**"). These patterns supplement .gitignore and built-in exclusions.
- `topFilesLength`: (Optional, default: 10) Number of largest files by size to display in the metrics summary for codebase analysis.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "remote": "yamadashy/repomix",
  "compress": false,
  "includePatterns": "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md",
  "ignorePatterns": "**/*.log,tmp/",
  "topFilesLength": 10
}
```

### read_repomix_output

This tool reads the contents of a Repomix-generated output file. Supports partial reading with line range specification for large files. This tool is designed for environments where direct file system access is limited.

**Parameters:**
- `outputId`: (Required) ID of the Repomix output file to read
- `startLine`: (Optional) Starting line number (1-based, inclusive). If not specified, reads from beginning.
- `endLine`: (Optional) Ending line number (1-based, inclusive). If not specified, reads to end.

**Features:**
- Specifically designed for web-based environments or sandboxed applications
- Retrieves the content of previously generated outputs using their ID
- Provides secure access to packed codebase without requiring file system access
- Supports partial reading for large files

**Example:**
```json
{
  "outputId": "8f7d3b1e2a9c6054",
  "startLine": 100,
  "endLine": 200
}
```

### grep_repomix_output

This tool searches for patterns in a Repomix output file using grep-like functionality with JavaScript RegExp syntax. Returns matching lines with optional context lines around matches.

**Parameters:**
- `outputId`: (Required) ID of the Repomix output file to search
- `pattern`: (Required) Search pattern (JavaScript RegExp regular expression syntax)
- `contextLines`: (Optional, default: 0) Number of context lines to show before and after each match. Overridden by beforeLines/afterLines if specified.
- `beforeLines`: (Optional) Number of context lines to show before each match (like grep -B). Takes precedence over contextLines.
- `afterLines`: (Optional) Number of context lines to show after each match (like grep -A). Takes precedence over contextLines.
- `ignoreCase`: (Optional, default: false) Perform case-insensitive matching

**Features:**
- Uses JavaScript RegExp syntax for powerful pattern matching
- Supports context lines for better understanding of matches
- Allows separate control of before/after context lines
- Case-sensitive and case-insensitive search options

**Example:**
```json
{
  "outputId": "8f7d3b1e2a9c6054",
  "pattern": "function\\s+\\w+\\(",
  "contextLines": 3,
  "ignoreCase": false
}
```

### file_system_read_file and file_system_read_directory

Repomix's MCP server provides two file system tools that allow AI assistants to safely interact with the local file system:

1. `file_system_read_file`
  - Reads file contents from the local file system using absolute paths
  - Includes built-in security validation to detect and prevent access to files containing sensitive information
  - Implements security validation using [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint)
  - Prevents access to files containing sensitive information (API keys, passwords, secrets)
  - Validates absolute paths to prevent directory traversal attacks
  - Returns formatted content with clear error messages for invalid paths or security issues

2. `file_system_read_directory`
  - Lists the contents of a directory using an absolute path
  - Returns a formatted list showing files and subdirectories with clear indicators
  - Shows both files and directories with clear indicators (`[FILE]` or `[DIR]`)
  - Provides safe directory traversal with proper error handling
  - Validates paths and ensures they are absolute
  - Useful for exploring project structure and understanding codebase organization

Both tools incorporate robust security measures:
- Absolute path validation to prevent directory traversal attacks
- Permission checks to ensure proper access rights
- Integration with Secretlint for sensitive information detection
- Clear error messaging for better debugging and security awareness

**Example:**
```typescript
// Reading a file
const fileContent = await tools.file_system_read_file({
  path: '/absolute/path/to/file.txt'
});

// Listing directory contents
const dirContent = await tools.file_system_read_directory({
  path: '/absolute/path/to/directory'
});
```

These tools are particularly useful when AI assistants need to:
- Analyze specific files in the codebase
- Navigate directory structures
- Verify file existence and accessibility
- Ensure secure file system operations

## Benefits of Using Repomix as an MCP Server

Using Repomix as an MCP server offers several advantages:

1. **Direct Integration**: AI assistants can directly analyze your codebase without manual file preparation.
2. **Efficient Workflow**: Streamlines the process of code analysis by eliminating the need to manually generate and upload files.
3. **Consistent Output**: Ensures that the AI assistant receives the codebase in a consistent, optimized format.
4. **Advanced Features**: Leverages all of Repomix's features like code compression, token counting, and security checks.

Once configured, your AI assistant can directly use Repomix's capabilities to analyze codebases, making code analysis workflows more efficient.

# Output Formats

Repomix supports four output formats:
- XML (default)
- Markdown
- JSON
- Plain Text 

## XML Format

```bash
repomix --style xml
```

XML format is optimized for AI processing:

```xml
This file is a merged representation of the entire codebase...

<file_summary>
(Metadata and AI instructions)
</file_summary>

<directory_structure>
src/
  index.ts
  utils/
    helper.ts
</directory_structure>

<files>
<file path="src/index.ts">
// File contents here
</file>
</files>

</git_logs>
```

### Why XML as Default Format?
Repomix uses XML as the default output format based on extensive research and testing. This decision is grounded in both empirical evidence and practical considerations for AI-assisted code analysis.

Our choice of XML is primarily influenced by official recommendations from major AI providers:
- **Anthropic (Claude)**: Explicitly recommends XML tags for structuring prompts, stating that "Claude was exposed to such prompts during training" ([source](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/use-xml-tags))
- **Google (Gemini)**: Recommends structured formats including XML for complex tasks ([documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/structure-prompts))
- **OpenAI (GPT)**: Advocates for structured prompting in complex scenarios ([announcement](https://x.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1890147300493914437), [cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5_prompting_guide))

## Markdown Format

```bash
repomix --style markdown
```

Markdown provides readable formatting:

````markdown

# Directory Structure
```
src/
index.ts
utils/
helper.ts

````

## JSON Format

```bash
repomix --style json
```

JSON format provides structured, programmatically accessible output with camelCase property names:

```json
{
  "fileSummary": {
    "generationHeader": "This file is a merged representation of the entire codebase, combined into a single document by Repomix.",
    "purpose": "This file contains a packed representation of the entire repository's contents...",
    "fileFormat": "The content is organized as follows...",
    "usageGuidelines": "- This file should be treated as read-only...",
    "notes": "- Some files may have been excluded based on .gitignore rules..."
  },
  "userProvidedHeader": "Custom header text if specified",
  "directoryStructure": "src/
  cli/
    cliOutput.ts
    index.ts
  config/
    configLoader.ts",
  "files": {
    "src/index.js": "// File contents here",
    "src/utils.js": "// File contents here"
  },
  "instruction": "Custom instructions from instructionFilePath"
}
```

### Benefits of JSON Format

The JSON format is ideal for:
- **Programmatic processing**: Easy to parse and manipulate with JSON libraries in any programming language
- **API integration**: Direct consumption by web services and applications  
- **AI tool compatibility**: Structured format optimized for machine learning and AI systems
- **Data analysis**: Straightforward extraction of specific information using tools like `jq`

### Working with JSON Output Using `jq`

The JSON format makes it easy to extract specific information programmatically. Here are common examples:

#### Basic File Operations
```bash
# List all file paths
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[]'

# Count total number of files
cat repomix-output.json | jq '.files | keys | length'

# Extract specific file content
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files["README.md"]'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files["src/index.js"]'
```

#### File Filtering and Analysis
```bash
# Find files by extension
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(endswith(".ts"))'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(endswith(".js") or endswith(".ts"))'

# Get files containing specific text
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | select(.value | contains("function")) | .key'

# Create a file list with character counts
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | "\(.key): \(.value | length) characters"'
```

#### Metadata Extraction
```bash
# Extract directory structure
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.directoryStructure'

# Get file summary information
cat repomix-output.json | jq '.fileSummary.purpose'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.fileSummary.generationHeader'

# Extract user-provided header (if exists)
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.userProvidedHeader // "No header provided"'

# Get custom instructions
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.instruction // "No instructions provided"'
```

#### Advanced Analysis
```bash
# Find largest files by content length
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | [.key, (.value | length)] | @tsv' | sort -k2 -nr | head -10

# Search for files containing specific patterns
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | select(.value | test("import.*react"; "i")) | .key'

# Extract file paths matching multiple extensions
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(test("\.(js|ts|jsx|tsx)$"))'
```

## Plain Text Format

```bash
repomix --style plain
```

Output structure:
```text
This file is a merged representation of the entire codebase...

================
File Summary
================
(Metadata and AI instructions)

- Use Markdown for general readability
- Use JSON for programmatic processing and API integration
- Use Plain Text for simplicity and universal compatibility

## Customization

Set default format in `repomix.config.json`:
```json
{
  "output": {
    "style": "xml",
    "filePath": "output.xml"
  }
}
```

# Security

## Security Check Feature

Repomix uses [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint) to detect sensitive information in your files:
- API keys
- Access tokens
- Credentials
- Private keys
- Environment variables

## Configuration

Security checks are enabled by default.

Disable via CLI:
```bash
repomix --no-security-check
```

Or in `repomix.config.json`:
```json
{
  "security": {
    "enableSecurityCheck": false
  }
}
```

## Security Measures

1. **Binary File Handling**: Binary file contents are excluded from output, but their paths are listed in the directory structure for complete repository overview
2. **Git-Aware**: Respects `.gitignore` patterns
3. **Automated Detection**: Scans for common security issues:
  - AWS credentials
  - Database connection strings
  - Authentication tokens
  - Private keys

## When Security Check Finds Issues

Example output:
```bash
🔍 Security Check:
──────────────────
2 suspicious file(s) detected and excluded:
1. config/credentials.json
  - Found AWS access key
2. .env.local
  - Found database password
```

## Best Practices

1. Always review output before sharing
2. Use `.repomixignore` for sensitive paths
3. Keep security checks enabled
4. Remove sensitive files from repository

## Reporting Security Issues

Found a security vulnerability? Please:
1. Do not open a public issue
2. Email: koukun0120@gmail.com
3. Or use [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/security/advisories/new)

# Basic Usage

## Quick Start

Pack your entire repository:
```bash
repomix
```

## Common Use Cases

### Pack Specific Directories
```bash
repomix path/to/directory
```

### Include Specific Files
Use [glob patterns](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax):
```bash
repomix --include "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md"
```

### Exclude Files
```bash
repomix --ignore "**/*.log,tmp/"
```

### Remote Repositories
```bash
# Using GitHub URL
repomix --remote https://github.com/user/repo

# Using shorthand
repomix --remote user/repo

# Specific branch/tag/commit
repomix --remote user/repo --remote-branch main
repomix --remote user/repo --remote-branch 935b695
```

### File List Input (stdin)

Pass file paths via stdin for ultimate flexibility:

```bash
# Using find command
find src -name "*.ts" -type f | repomix --stdin

# Using git to get tracked files
git ls-files "*.ts" | repomix --stdin

# Using ripgrep (rg) to find files
rg --files --type ts | repomix --stdin

# Using grep to find files containing specific content
grep -l "TODO" **/*.ts | repomix --stdin

# Using ripgrep to find files with specific content
rg -l "TODO|FIXME" --type ts | repomix --stdin

# Using sharkdp/fd to find files
fd -e ts | repomix --stdin

# Using fzf to select from all files
fzf -m | repomix --stdin

# Interactive file selection with fzf
find . -name "*.ts" -type f | fzf -m | repomix --stdin

# Using ls with glob patterns
ls src/**/*.ts | repomix --stdin

# From a file containing file paths
cat file-list.txt | repomix --stdin

# Direct input with echo
echo -e "src/index.ts\nsrc/utils.ts" | repomix --stdin
```

The `--stdin` option allows you to pipe a list of file paths to Repomix, giving you ultimate flexibility in selecting which files to pack.

When using `--stdin`, the specified files are effectively added to the include patterns. This means that the normal include and ignore behavior still applies - files specified via stdin will still be excluded if they match ignore patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> When using `--stdin`, file paths can be relative or absolute, and Repomix will automatically handle path resolution and deduplication.

### Code Compression

```bash
repomix --compress

# You can also use it with remote repositories:
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix --compress
```

### Git Integration

Include Git information to provide development context for AI analysis:

```bash
# Include git diffs (uncommitted changes)
repomix --include-diffs

# Include git commit logs (last 50 commits by default)
repomix --include-logs

# Include specific number of commits
repomix --include-logs --include-logs-count 10

# Include both diffs and logs
repomix --include-diffs --include-logs
```

This adds valuable context about:
- **Recent changes**: Git diffs show uncommitted modifications
- **Development patterns**: Git logs reveal which files are typically changed together
- **Commit history**: Recent commit messages provide insight into development focus
- **File relationships**: Understanding which files are modified in the same commits

### Token Count Optimization

Understanding your codebase's token distribution is crucial for optimizing AI interactions. Use the `--token-count-tree` option to visualize token usage across your project:

```bash
repomix --token-count-tree
```

This displays a hierarchical view of your codebase with token counts:

```
🔢 Token Count Tree:
────────────────────
└── src/ (70,925 tokens)
    ├── cli/ (12,714 tokens)
    │   ├── actions/ (7,546 tokens)
    │   └── reporters/ (990 tokens)
    └── core/ (41,600 tokens)
        ├── file/ (10,098 tokens)
        └── output/ (5,808 tokens)
```

You can also set a minimum token threshold to focus on larger files:

```bash
repomix --token-count-tree 1000  # Only show files/directories with 1000+ tokens
```

This helps you:
- **Identify token-heavy files** that might exceed AI context limits
- **Optimize file selection** using `--include` and `--ignore` patterns  
- **Plan compression strategies** by targeting the largest contributors
- **Balance content vs. context** when preparing code for AI analysis

## Output Formats

### XML (Default)
```bash
repomix --style xml
```

### Markdown
```bash
repomix --style markdown
```

### JSON
```bash
repomix --style json
```

### Plain Text
```bash
repomix --style plain
```

## Additional Options

```bash
repomix --remove-comments
```

### Show Line Numbers
```bash
repomix --output-show-line-numbers
```

### Copy to Clipboard
```bash
repomix --copy
```

## 🏆 Open Source Awards Nomination

We're honored! Repomix has been nominated for the **Powered by AI** category at the [JSNation Open Source Awards 2025](https://osawards.com/javascript/).

This wouldn't have been possible without all of you using and supporting Repomix. Thank you!

## What is Repomix?

Repomix is a powerful tool that packages your entire codebase into a single AI-friendly file. Whether you're working on code reviews, refactoring, or getting AI assistance with your project, Repomix makes it easy to share your entire repository context with AI tools.

<YouTubeVideo :videoId="VIDEO_IDS.REPOMIX_DEMO" />

## Quick Start

Once you've generated a packed file (`repomix-output.xml`) using Repomix, you can send it to an AI assistant (like ChatGPT, Claude) with a prompt like:

```
This file contains all the files in the repository combined into one.
I want to refactor the code, so please review it first.
```

The AI will analyze your entire codebase and provide comprehensive insights:

![Repomix File Usage 1](/images/docs/repomix-file-usage-1.png)

When discussing specific changes, the AI can help generate code. With features like Claude's Artifacts, you can even receive multiple interdependent files:

Happy coding! 🚀

## Why Repomix?

Repomix's strength lies in its ability to work with any subscription service like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok without worrying about costs, while providing complete codebase context that eliminates the need for file exploration—making analysis faster and often more accurate.

With the entire codebase available as context, Repomix enables a wide range of applications including implementation planning, bug investigation, third-party library security checks, documentation generation, and much more.

## Using the CLI Tool {#using-the-cli-tool}

Repomix can be used as a command-line tool, offering powerful features and customization options.

**The CLI tool can access private repositories** as it uses your locally installed git.

### Quick Start

You can try Repomix instantly in your project directory without installation:

```bash
npx repomix@latest
```

Or install globally for repeated use:

```bash
# Install using npm
npm install -g repomix

# Alternatively using yarn
yarn global add repomix

# Alternatively using bun
bun add -g repomix

# Alternatively using Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
brew install repomix

# Then run in any project directory
repomix
```

That's it! Repomix will generate a `repomix-output.xml` file in your current directory, containing your entire repository in an AI-friendly format.



### Usage

To pack your entire repository:

```bash
repomix
```

To pack a specific directory:

```bash
repomix path/to/directory
```

To pack specific files or directories using [glob patterns](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax):

```bash
repomix --include "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md"
```

To exclude specific files or directories:

```bash
repomix --ignore "**/*.log,tmp/"
```

To pack a remote repository:
```bash
# Using shorthand format
npx repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix

# Using full URL (supports branches and specific paths)
npx repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix
npx repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/tree/main

# Using commit's URL
npx repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/commit/836...
```

To initialize a new configuration file (`repomix.config.json`):

```bash
repomix --init
```

Once you have generated the packed file, you can use it with Generative AI tools like Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini.

# Usar Repomix como Biblioteca

Además de usar Repomix como herramienta CLI, puedes integrar su funcionalidad directamente en tus aplicaciones Node.js.

## Instalación

Instala Repomix como dependencia en tu proyecto:

```bash
npm install repomix
```

## Uso Básico

La forma más sencilla de usar Repomix es a través de la función `runCli`, que proporciona la misma funcionalidad que la interfaz de línea de comandos:

```javascript
import { runCli, type CliOptions } from 'repomix';

// Procesar el directorio actual con opciones personalizadas
async function packProject() {
  const options = {
    output: 'output.xml',
    style: 'xml',
    compress: true,
    quiet: true
  } as CliOptions;
  
  const result = await runCli(['.'], process.cwd(), options);
  return result.packResult;
}
```

El `result.packResult` contiene información sobre los archivos procesados, incluyendo:
- `totalFiles`: Número de archivos procesados
- `totalCharacters`: Recuento total de caracteres
- `totalTokens`: Recuento total de tokens (útil para límites de contexto de LLM)
- `fileCharCounts`: Recuento de caracteres por archivo
- `fileTokenCounts`: Recuento de tokens por archivo

## Procesamiento de Repositorios Remotos

Puedes clonar y procesar un repositorio remoto:

```javascript
import { runCli, type CliOptions } from 'repomix';

// Clonar y procesar un repositorio de GitHub
async function processRemoteRepo(repoUrl) {
  const options = {
    remote: repoUrl,
    output: 'output.xml',
    compress: true
  } as CliOptions;
  
  return await runCli(['.'], process.cwd(), options);
}
```

## Uso de Componentes Principales

Para un mayor control, puedes usar las APIs de bajo nivel de Repomix directamente:

```javascript
import { searchFiles, collectFiles, processFiles, TokenCounter } from 'repomix';

async function analyzeFiles(directory) {
  // Encontrar y recopilar archivos
  const { filePaths } = await searchFiles(directory, { /* configuración */ });
  const rawFiles = await collectFiles(filePaths, directory);
  const processedFiles = await processFiles(rawFiles, { /* configuración */ });
  
  // Contar tokens
  const tokenCounter = new TokenCounter('o200k_base');
  
  // Devolver resultados del análisis
  return processedFiles.map(file => ({
    path: file.path,
    tokens: tokenCounter.countTokens(file.content)
  }));
}
```

## Ejemplo del Mundo Real

El sitio web de Repomix ([repomix.com](https://repomix.com)) utiliza Repomix como biblioteca para procesar repositorios remotos. Puedes ver la implementación en [website/server/src/remoteRepo.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/....ts).

# Mejores prácticas para el desarrollo asistido por IA: Desde mi experiencia

Aunque todavía no he completado con éxito un proyecto a gran escala utilizando IA, me gustaría compartir lo que he aprendido hasta ahora de mi experiencia trabajando con IA en el desarrollo.

## Enfoque de desarrollo básico

Cuando se trabaja con IA, intentar implementar todas las funciones a la vez puede llevar a problemas inesperados y al estancamiento del proyecto. Por eso es más efectivo comenzar con la funcionalidad principal y construir cada función una por una, asegurando una implementación sólida antes de seguir adelante.

### El poder del código existente

Este enfoque es efectivo porque implementar la funcionalidad principal te permite materializar tu diseño ideal y estilo de codificación a través de código real. La forma más efectiva de comunicar la visión de tu proyecto es a través de código que refleje tus estándares y preferencias.

Al comenzar con las funciones principales y asegurar que cada componente funcione correctamente antes de continuar, todo el proyecto mantiene la consistencia, lo que facilita que la IA genere código más apropiado.

## El enfoque modular

Dividir el código en módulos más pequeños es crucial. En mi experiencia, mantener los archivos alrededor de 250 líneas de código facilita dar instrucciones claras a la IA y hace que el proceso de prueba y error sea más eficiente. Si bien el recuento de tokens sería una métrica más precisa, el recuento de líneas es más práctico para los desarrolladores humanos, por lo que lo usamos como una guía.

Esta modularización no se trata solo de separar los componentes de frontend, backend y base de datos, sino de desglosar la funcionalidad a un nivel mucho más fino. Por ejemplo, dentro de una sola función, podrías separar la validación, el manejo de errores y otras funcionalidades específicas en módulos distintos. Por supuesto, la separación de alto nivel también es importante, e implementar este enfoque modular gradualmente ayuda a mantener instrucciones claras y permite que la IA genere código más apropiado. Este enfoque es efectivo no solo para la IA sino también para los desarrolladores humanos.

## Asegurar la calidad a través de las pruebas

Considero que las pruebas son cruciales en el desarrollo asistido por IA. Las pruebas no solo sirven como medidas de garantía de calidad, sino también como documentación que demuestra claramente las intenciones del código. Al pedirle a la IA que implemente nuevas funciones, el código de prueba existente actúa efectivamente como un documento de especificación.

Las pruebas también son una excelente herramienta para validar la corrección del código generado por IA. Por ejemplo, al hacer que la IA implemente una nueva funcionalidad para un módulo, escribir casos de prueba de antemano te permite evaluar objetivamente si el código generado se comporta como se espera. Esto se alinea bien con los principios de desarrollo basado en pruebas (TDD) y es particularmente efectivo cuando se colabora con la IA.

## Equilibrar la planificación y la implementación

Antes de implementar funciones a gran escala, recomiendo discutir primero el plan con la IA. Organizar los requisitos y considerar la arquitectura conduce a una implementación más fluida. Una buena práctica es compilar primero los requisitos y luego pasar a una sesión de chat separada para el trabajo de implementación.

Es esencial que un humano revise el resultado de la IA y haga los ajustes necesarios. Si bien la calidad del código generado por IA es generalmente moderada, aún acelera el desarrollo en comparación con escribir todo desde cero.

## Conclusión

Siguiendo estas prácticas, puedes aprovechar las fortalezas de la IA mientras construyes una base de código consistente y de alta calidad. Incluso a medida que tu proyecto crece en tamaño, cada componente permanece bien definido y manejable.

# Generación de Agent Skills

Repomix puede generar salida en formato [Claude Agent Skills](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills), creando un directorio estructurado de Skills que puede usarse como referencia de código reutilizable para asistentes de IA.

Esta función es particularmente poderosa cuando desea referenciar implementaciones de repositorios remotos. Al generar Skills desde proyectos de código abierto, puede fácilmente pedir a Claude que referencie patrones o implementaciones específicas mientras trabaja en su propio código.

En lugar de generar un único archivo empaquetado, la generación de Skills crea un directorio estructurado con múltiples archivos de referencia optimizados para la comprensión de IA y búsqueda compatible con grep.

> [!NOTE]
> Esta es una función experimental. El formato de salida y las opciones pueden cambiar en futuras versiones basándose en los comentarios de los usuarios.

## Uso Básico

Generar Skills desde su directorio local:

```bash
# Generar Skills desde el directorio actual
repomix --skill-generate

# Generar con nombre personalizado de Skills
repomix --skill-generate my-project-reference

# Generar desde un directorio específico
repomix path/to/directory --skill-generate

# Generar desde repositorio remoto
repomix --remote https://github.com/user/repo --skill-generate
```

## Selección de Ubicación de Skills

Cuando ejecuta el comando, Repomix le solicita elegir dónde guardar los Skills:

1. **Personal Skills** (`~/.claude/skills/`) - Disponible en todos los proyectos de su máquina
2. **Project Skills** (`.claude/skills/`) - Compartido con su equipo vía git

Si el directorio de Skills ya existe, se le pedirá confirmar la sobrescritura.

> [!TIP]
> Al generar Project Skills, considere agregarlos a `.gitignore` para evitar hacer commit de archivos grandes:
> ```gitignore
> .claude/skills/repomix-reference-*/
> ```

## Estructura Generada

Los Skills se generan con la siguiente estructura:

```text
.claude/skills/<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md                    # Metadatos principales y documentación de Skills
└── references/
    ├── summary.md              # Propósito, formato y estadísticas
    ├── project-structure.md    # Árbol de directorios con conteo de líneas
    ├── files.md                # Todo el contenido de archivos (compatible con grep)
    └── tech-stack.md           # Lenguajes, frameworks, dependencias
```

### Descripciones de Archivos

#### SKILL.md

El archivo principal de Skills contiene:
- Nombre del Skills, descripción e información del proyecto
- Conteo de archivos, líneas y tokens
- Resumen de cómo usar los Skills
- Ubicaciones de archivos y explicación del formato
- Casos de uso comunes y consejos

#### references/summary.md

Contiene:
- **Propósito**: Explica que es un código base de referencia para consumo de IA
- **Estructura de Archivos**: Documenta el contenido de cada archivo de referencia
- **Guías de Uso**: Cómo usar los Skills efectivamente
- **Estadísticas**: Desglose por tipo de archivo, lenguaje y archivos más grandes

#### references/project-structure.md

Árbol de directorios con conteo de líneas por archivo para fácil descubrimiento:

```text
src/
  index.ts (42 lines)
  utils/
    helpers.ts (128 lines)
    math.ts (87 lines)
```

#### references/files.md

Todo el contenido de archivos con encabezados de resaltado de sintaxis, optimizado para búsqueda compatible con grep:

````markdown
## File: src/index.ts
```typescript
import { sum } from './utils/helpers';

export function main() {
  console.log(sum(1, 2));
}
```
````

#### references/tech-stack.md

Stack tecnológico autodetectado desde archivos de dependencias:
- **Lenguajes**: TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, etc.
- **Frameworks**: React, Next.js, Express, Django, etc.
- **Versiones de Runtime**: Node.js, Python, Go, etc.
- **Gestor de Paquetes**: npm, pnpm, poetry, etc.
- **Dependencias**: Todas las dependencias directas y de desarrollo
- **Archivos de Configuración**: Todos los archivos de configuración detectados

Detectado desde archivos como: `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `.nvmrc`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.

## Nombres de Skills Autogenerados

Si no se proporciona nombre, Repomix autogenera uno usando este patrón:

```bash
repomix src/ --skill-generate                # → repomix-reference-src
repomix --remote user/repo --skill-generate  # → repomix-reference-repo
repomix --skill-generate CustomName          # → custom-name (normalizado a kebab-case)
```

Los nombres de Skills son:
- Convertidos a kebab-case (minúsculas, separados por guiones)
- Limitados a máximo 64 caracteres
- Protegidos contra path traversal

## Integración con Opciones de Repomix

La generación de Skills respeta todas las opciones estándar de Repomix:

```bash
# Generar Skills con filtrado de archivos
repomix --skill-generate --include "src/**/*.ts" --ignore "**/*.test.ts"

# Generar Skills con compresión
repomix --skill-generate --compress

# Generar Skills desde repositorio remoto
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix --skill-generate

# Generar Skills con opciones específicas de formato de salida
repomix --skill-generate --remove-comments --remove-empty-lines
```

### Skills Solo de Documentación

Usando `--include`, puede generar Skills que contengan solo la documentación de un repositorio de GitHub. Esto es útil cuando desea que Claude referencie documentación específica de biblioteca o framework mientras trabaja en su código:

```bash
# Documentación de Claude Code Action
repomix --remote https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action --include docs --skill-generate

# Documentación de Vite
repomix --remote https://github.com/vitejs/vite --include docs --skill-generate

# Documentación de React
repomix --remote https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev --include src/content --skill-generate
```

## Limitaciones

La opción `--skill-generate` no puede usarse con:
- `--stdout` - La salida de Skills requiere escribir en el sistema de archivos
- `--copy` - La salida de Skills es un directorio, no se puede copiar al portapapeles

## Usando Skills Generados

Una vez generados, puede usar los Skills con Claude:

1. **Claude Code**: Los Skills están disponibles automáticamente si se guardan en `~/.claude/skills/` o `.claude/skills/`
2. **Claude Web**: Suba el directorio de Skills a Claude para análisis de código base
3. **Compartir con Equipo**: Haga commit de `.claude/skills/` a su repositorio para acceso de todo el equipo

## Flujo de Trabajo de Ejemplo

### Crear una Biblioteca de Referencia Personal

```bash
# Clonar y analizar un proyecto de código abierto interesante
repomix --remote facebook/react --skill-generate react-reference

# Los Skills se guardan en ~/.claude/skills/react-reference/
# Ahora puede referenciar el código base de React en cualquier conversación con Claude
```

### Documentación de Proyecto de Equipo

```bash
# En su directorio de proyecto
cd my-project

# Generar Skills para su equipo
repomix --skill-generate

# Elija "Project Skills" cuando se le solicite
# Los Skills se guardan en .claude/skills/repomix-reference-my-project/

# Haga commit y comparta con su equipo
git add .claude/skills/
git commit -m "Add codebase reference Skills"
```

## File: website/client/src/es/guide/code-compress.md
`````markdown
# Compresión de Código

La compresión de código es una función poderosa que extrae de manera inteligente las estructuras esenciales del código mientras elimina los detalles de implementación. Esto es particularmente útil para reducir el conteo de tokens mientras se mantiene la información estructural importante de tu base de código.

> [!NOTE]
> Esta es una función experimental que mejoraremos activamente según los comentarios de los usuarios y el uso en el mundo real.

## Uso Básico

Habilita la compresión de código usando la bandera `--compress`:

```bash
repomix --compress
```

También puedes usarlo con repositorios remotos:

```bash
repomix --remote user/repo --compress
```

## Cómo Funciona

El algoritmo de compresión procesa el código utilizando el análisis de Tree-sitter para extraer y preservar elementos estructurales esenciales mientras elimina los detalles de implementación.

La compresión preserva:
- Firmas de funciones y métodos
- Definiciones de interfaces y tipos
- Estructuras de clases y propiedades
- Elementos estructurales importantes

Mientras elimina:
- Implementaciones de funciones y métodos
- Detalles de lógica de bucles y condicionales
- Declaraciones de variables internas
- Código específico de implementación

### Ejemplo

Código TypeScript original:

```typescript
import { ShoppingItem } from './shopping-item';

/**
 * Calculate the total price of shopping items
 */
const calculateTotal = (
  items: ShoppingItem[]
) => {
  let total = 0;
  for (const item of items) {
    total += item.price * item.quantity;
  }
  return total;
}

// Shopping item interface
interface Item {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  quantity: number;
}
```

Después de la compresión:

```typescript
import { ShoppingItem } from './shopping-item';
⋮----
/**
 * Calculate the total price of shopping items
 */
const calculateTotal = (
  items: ShoppingItem[]
) => {
⋮----
// Shopping item interface
interface Item {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  quantity: number;
}
```

## Configuración

Puedes habilitar la compresión en tu archivo de configuración:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "compress": true
  }
}
```

## Casos de Uso

La compresión de código es particularmente útil cuando:
- Analizas la estructura y arquitectura del código
- Reduces el conteo de tokens para procesamiento con LLM
- Creas documentación de alto nivel
- Comprendes patrones y firmas de código
- Compartes diseños de API e interfaces

## Opciones Relacionadas

## File: website/client/src/es/guide/comment-removal.md
`````markdown
# Eliminación de comentarios

Repomix puede eliminar automáticamente los comentarios de tu código al generar el archivo de salida. Esto puede ayudar a reducir el ruido y centrarse en el código real.

## Uso

Para habilitar la eliminación de comentarios, establece la opción `removeComments` a `true` en tu archivo `repomix.config.json`:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "removeComments": true
  }
}
```

## Lenguajes soportados

Repomix soporta la eliminación de comentarios para una amplia gama de lenguajes de programación, incluyendo:

- JavaScript/TypeScript (`//`, `/* */`)
- Python (`#`, `"""`, `'''`)
- Java (`//`, `/* */`)
- C/C++ (`//`, `/* */`)
- HTML (`<!-- -->`)
- CSS (`/* */`)
- Y muchos más...

## Ejemplo

Dado el siguiente código JavaScript:

```javascript
// Este es un comentario de una sola línea
function test() {
  /* Este es un
     comentario multilínea */
  return true;
}
```

Con la eliminación de comentarios habilitada, la salida será:

```javascript
function test() {
  return true;
}
```

## Notas

- La eliminación de comentarios se realiza antes que otros pasos de procesamiento, como la adición de números de línea.
- Algunos comentarios, como los comentarios JSDoc, pueden conservarse dependiendo del lenguaje y el contexto.

`````markdown
# Configuración

Repomix puede configurarse mediante un archivo de configuración o opciones de línea de comandos. El archivo de configuración le permite personalizar varios aspectos de cómo se procesa y genera la salida de su base de código.

## Formatos de archivos de configuración

Repomix admite múltiples formatos de archivos de configuración para mayor flexibilidad y facilidad de uso.

Repomix buscará automáticamente archivos de configuración en el siguiente orden de prioridad:

1. **TypeScript** (`repomix.config.ts`, `repomix.config.mts`, `repomix.config.cts`)
2. **JavaScript/ES Module** (`repomix.config.js`, `repomix.config.mjs`, `repomix.config.cjs`)
3. **JSON** (`repomix.config.json5`, `repomix.config.jsonc`, `repomix.config.json`)

### Configuración JSON

Cree un archivo de configuración en el directorio de su proyecto:
```bash
repomix --init
```

Esto creará un archivo `repomix.config.json` con la configuración predeterminada. También puede crear un archivo de configuración global que se utilizará como respaldo cuando no se encuentre una configuración local:

```bash
repomix --init --global
```

### Configuración TypeScript

Los archivos de configuración TypeScript ofrecen la mejor experiencia de desarrollo con verificación completa de tipos y soporte IDE.

**Instalación:**

Para usar la configuración TypeScript o JavaScript con `defineConfig`, debe instalar Repomix como dependencia de desarrollo:

```bash
npm install -D repomix
```

**Ejemplo:**

```typescript
// repomix.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'repomix';

export default defineConfig({
  output: {
    filePath: 'output.xml',
    style: 'xml',
    removeComments: true,
  },
  ignore: {
    customPatterns: ['**/node_modules/**', '**/dist/**'],
  },
});
```

**Ventajas:**
- ✅ Verificación completa de tipos TypeScript en su IDE
- ✅ Excelente autocompletado e IntelliSense del IDE
- ✅ Uso de valores dinámicos (marcas de tiempo, variables de entorno, etc.)

**Ejemplo de valores dinámicos:**

```typescript
// repomix.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'repomix';

// Generar nombre de archivo basado en marca de tiempo
const timestamp = new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 19).replace(/[:.]/g, '-');

export default defineConfig({
  output: {
    filePath: `output-${timestamp}.xml`,
    style: 'xml',
  },
});
```

### Configuración JavaScript

Los archivos de configuración JavaScript funcionan igual que TypeScript, admitiendo `defineConfig` y valores dinámicos.

El archivo de configuración admite la sintaxis [JSON5](https://json5.org/), que permite:
- Comentarios (tanto de una línea como multilínea)
- Comas finales en objetos y arrays
- Nombres de propiedades sin comillas
- Sintaxis de cadena más flexible

## Validación de esquema

Puede habilitar la validación de esquema para su archivo de configuración agregando la propiedad `$schema`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://repomix.com/schemas/latest/schema.json",
  "output": {
    "filePath": "repomix-output.md",
    "style": "markdown"
  }
}
```

Esto proporciona autocompletado y validación en editores que admiten esquemas JSON.

## Ejemplo de archivo de configuración

Aquí hay un ejemplo de un archivo de configuración completo (`repomix.config.json`):

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://repomix.com/schemas/latest/schema.json",
  "input": {
    "maxFileSize": 50000000
  },
  "output": {
    "filePath": "repomix-output.xml",
    "style": "xml",
    "parsableStyle": false,
    "compress": false,

  }
}
```

## Ubicaciones de los archivos de configuración

Repomix busca los archivos de configuración en el siguiente orden:
1. Archivo de configuración local en el directorio actual (orden de prioridad: TS > JS > JSON)
   - TypeScript: `repomix.config.ts`, `repomix.config.mts`, `repomix.config.cts`
   - JavaScript: `repomix.config.js`, `repomix.config.mjs`, `repomix.config.cjs`
   - JSON: `repomix.config.json5`, `repomix.config.jsonc`, `repomix.config.json`
2. Archivo de configuración global (orden de prioridad: TS > JS > JSON)
   - Windows:
     - TypeScript: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.ts`, `.mts`, `.cts`
     - JavaScript: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`
     - JSON: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.json5`, `.jsonc`, `.json`
   - macOS/Linux:
     - TypeScript: `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.ts`, `.mts`, `.cts`
     - JavaScript: `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`
     - JSON: `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.json5`, `.jsonc`, `.json`

Las opciones de línea de comandos tienen prioridad sobre la configuración del archivo.

## Patrones de inclusión

Repomix admite especificar archivos para incluir usando [patrones glob](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax). Esto permite una selección de archivos más flexible y potente:

- Use `**/*.js` para incluir todos los archivos JavaScript en cualquier directorio
- Use `src/**/*` para incluir todos los archivos dentro del directorio `src` y sus subdirectorios
- Combine múltiples patrones como `["src/**/*.js", "**/*.md"]` para incluir archivos JavaScript en `src` y todos los archivos Markdown

Puede especificar patrones de inclusión en su archivo de configuración:

```json
{
  "include": ["src/**/*", "tests/**/*.test.js"]
}
```

O use la opción de línea de comandos `--include` para filtrado único.

## Patrones de ignorar

Repomix ofrece múltiples métodos para establecer patrones de ignorar para excluir archivos o directorios específicos durante el proceso de empaquetado:

- **.gitignore**: Por defecto, se utilizan los patrones listados en los archivos `.gitignore` de su proyecto y `.git/info/exclude`. Este comportamiento se puede controlar con la configuración `ignore.useGitignore` o la opción CLI `--no-gitignore`.
- **.ignore**: Puede usar un archivo `.ignore` en la raíz de su proyecto, siguiendo el mismo formato que `.gitignore`. Este archivo es respetado por herramientas como ripgrep y the silver searcher, reduciendo la necesidad de mantener múltiples archivos de ignorar. Este comportamiento se puede controlar con la configuración `ignore.useDotIgnore` o la opción CLI `--no-dot-ignore`.
- **Patrones predeterminados**: Repomix incluye una lista predeterminada de archivos y directorios comúnmente excluidos (por ejemplo, node_modules, .git, archivos binarios). Esta característica se puede controlar con la configuración `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` o la opción CLI `--no-default-patterns`. Consulte [defaultIgnore.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/src/config/defaultIgnore.ts) para más detalles.
- **.repomixignore**: Puede crear un archivo `.repomixignore` en la raíz de su proyecto para definir patrones de ignorar específicos de Repomix. Este archivo sigue el mismo formato que `.gitignore`.
- **Patrones personalizados**: Se pueden especificar patrones de ignorar adicionales usando la opción `ignore.customPatterns` en el archivo de configuración. Puede sobrescribir esta configuración con la opción de línea de comandos `-i, --ignore`.

**Orden de prioridad** (de mayor a menor):

1. Patrones personalizados (`ignore.customPatterns`)
2. Archivos de ignorar (`.repomixignore`, `.ignore`, `.gitignore` y `.git/info/exclude`):
   - Cuando están en directorios anidados, los archivos en directorios más profundos tienen mayor prioridad
   - Cuando están en el mismo directorio, estos archivos se fusionan sin un orden particular
3. Patrones predeterminados (si `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` es verdadero y `--no-default-patterns` no se usa)

Este enfoque permite una configuración flexible de exclusión de archivos basada en las necesidades de su proyecto. Ayuda a optimizar el tamaño del archivo empaquetado generado asegurando la exclusión de archivos sensibles a la seguridad y archivos binarios grandes, mientras previene la fuga de información confidencial.

**Nota:** Los archivos binarios no se incluyen en la salida empaquetada por defecto, pero sus rutas se listan en la sección "Estructura del Repositorio" del archivo de salida. Esto proporciona una visión completa de la estructura del repositorio mientras mantiene el archivo empaquetado eficiente y basado en texto. Consulte [Manejo de archivos binarios](#manejo-de-archivos-binarios) para más detalles.

Ejemplo de `.repomixignore`:
```text
# Directorios de caché
.cache/
tmp/

# Salidas de compilación
dist/
build/

# Registros
*.log
```

## Patrones de ignorar predeterminados

Cuando `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` es verdadero, Repomix ignora automáticamente patrones comunes:
```text
node_modules/**
.git/**
coverage/**
dist/**
```

Para la lista completa, vea [defaultIgnore.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/src/config/defaultIgnore.ts)

## Manejo de archivos binarios

Los archivos binarios (como imágenes, PDFs, binarios compilados, archivos, etc.) se manejan de manera especial para mantener una salida eficiente basada en texto:

- **Contenidos de archivo**: Los archivos binarios **no se incluyen** en la salida empaquetada para mantener el archivo basado en texto y eficiente para el procesamiento de IA
- **Estructura de directorios**: Las rutas de archivos binarios **se listan** en la sección de estructura de directorios, proporcionando una visión completa de su repositorio

Este enfoque garantiza que obtenga una vista completa de la estructura de su repositorio mientras mantiene una salida eficiente basada en texto optimizada para el consumo de IA.

**Ejemplo:**

Si su repositorio contiene `logo.png` y `app.jar`:
- Aparecerán en la sección Estructura de Directorios
- Sus contenidos no se incluirán en la sección Archivos

**Salida de Estructura de Directorios:**
```
src/
  index.ts
  utils.ts
assets/
  logo.png
build/
  app.jar
```

De esta manera, las herramientas de IA pueden entender que estos archivos binarios existen en la estructura de su proyecto sin procesar sus contenidos binarios.

**Nota:** Puede controlar el umbral de tamaño máximo de archivo usando la opción de configuración `input.maxFileSize` (predeterminado: 50MB). Los archivos más grandes que este límite se omitirán por completo.

## Características avanzadas

### Compresión de código

La función de compresión de código, habilitada con `output.compress: true`, utiliza [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) para extraer inteligentemente estructuras de código esenciales mientras elimina detalles de implementación. Esto ayuda a reducir el recuento de tokens mientras mantiene información estructural importante.

Beneficios principales:
- Reduce significativamente el recuento de tokens
- Preserva las firmas de clases y funciones
- Mantiene importaciones y exportaciones
- Conserva definiciones de tipos e interfaces
- Elimina cuerpos de funciones y detalles de implementación

Para más detalles y ejemplos, consulte la [Guía de compresión de código](code-compress).

### Integración con Git

La configuración `output.git` proporciona potentes características relacionadas con Git:

- `sortByChanges`: Cuando es verdadero, los archivos se ordenan por número de cambios Git (commits que modificaron el archivo). Los archivos con más cambios aparecen al final de la salida. Esto ayuda a priorizar los archivos más activamente desarrollados. Predeterminado: `true`
- `sortByChangesMaxCommits`: El número máximo de commits para analizar al contar cambios de archivos. Predeterminado: `100`
- `includeDiffs`: Cuando es verdadero, incluye las diferencias Git en la salida (incluye por separado los cambios del árbol de trabajo y los cambios preparados). Esto permite al lector ver los cambios pendientes en el repositorio. Predeterminado: `false`
- `includeLogs`: Cuando es verdadero, incluye el historial de commits Git en la salida. Muestra fechas de commits, mensajes y rutas de archivos para cada commit. Esto ayuda a la IA a entender patrones de desarrollo y relaciones entre archivos. Predeterminado: `false`
- `includeLogsCount`: El número de commits recientes a incluir en los logs de git. Predeterminado: `50`

Ejemplo de configuración:
```json
{
  "output": {
    "git": {
      "sortByChanges": true,
      "sortByChangesMaxCommits": 100,
      "includeDiffs": true,
      "includeLogs": true,
      "includeLogsCount": 25
    }
  }
}
```

### Comprobaciones de seguridad

Cuando `security.enableSecurityCheck` está habilitado, Repomix utiliza [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint) para detectar información sensible en su base de código antes de incluirla en la salida. Esto ayuda a prevenir la exposición accidental de:

- Claves de API
- Tokens de acceso
- Claves privadas
- Contraseñas
- Otras credenciales sensibles

### Eliminación de comentarios

Cuando `output.removeComments` se establece en `true`, los comentarios se eliminan de los tipos de archivos soportados para reducir el tamaño de salida y enfocarse en el contenido esencial del código. Esto puede ser particularmente útil cuando:

- Está trabajando con código muy documentado
- Está tratando de reducir el recuento de tokens
- Se está enfocando en la estructura y lógica del código

Para los lenguajes soportados y ejemplos detallados, consulte la [Guía de eliminación de comentarios](comment-removal).

## File: website/client/src/es/guide/custom-instructions.md
`````markdown
# Instrucciones Personalizadas

Repomix te permite proporcionar instrucciones personalizadas que se incluirán en el archivo de salida. Esto puede ser útil para agregar contexto o pautas específicas para los sistemas de IA que procesan el repositorio.

## Uso

Para incluir una instrucción personalizada, crea un archivo markdown (por ejemplo, `repomix-instruction.md`) en la raíz de tu repositorio. Luego, especifica la ruta a este archivo en tu `repomix.config.json`:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "instructionFilePath": "repomix-instruction.md"
  }
}
```

El contenido de este archivo se incluirá en la salida bajo la sección "Instruction".

## Ejemplo

```markdown
# Instrucciones del Repositorio

Este repositorio contiene el código fuente de la herramienta Repomix. Por favor, sigue estas pautas al analizar el código:

1. Concéntrate en la funcionalidad principal en el directorio `src/core`.
2. Presta especial atención a las verificaciones de seguridad en `src/core/security`.
3. Ignora cualquier archivo en el directorio `tests`.
```

Esto resultará en la siguiente sección en la salida:

```xml
<instruction>
# Instrucciones del Repositorio

Este repositorio contiene el código fuente de la herramienta Repomix. Por favor, sigue estas pautas al analizar el código:

1. Concéntrate en la funcionalidad principal en el directorio `src/core`.
2. Presta especial atención a las verificaciones de seguridad en `src/core/security`.
3. Ignora cualquier archivo en el directorio `tests`.
</instruction>

# Usar Repomix con GitHub Actions

Puedes automatizar el empaquetado de tu base de código para análisis por IA integrando Repomix en tus flujos de trabajo de GitHub Actions. Esto es útil para integración continua (CI), revisión de código o preparación para herramientas LLM.

## Uso básico

Agrega el siguiente paso a tu archivo YAML de workflow para empaquetar tu repositorio:

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    output: repomix-output.xml
```

## Usar diferentes formatos de salida

Puedes especificar diferentes formatos de salida utilizando el parámetro `style` (el predeterminado es `xml`):

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    output: repomix-output.md
    style: markdown
```

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix (JSON format)
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    output: repomix-output.json
    style: json
```

## Empaquetar múltiples directorios con compresión

Puedes especificar múltiples directorios, patrones de inclusión/exclusión y habilitar la compresión inteligente:

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    directories: src tests
    include: "**/*.ts,**/*.md"
    ignore: "**/*.test.ts"
    output: repomix-output.xml
    compress: true
```

## Subir el archivo de salida como artefacto

Para que el archivo empaquetado esté disponible para pasos posteriores o para descarga, súbelo como artefacto:

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    directories: src
    output: repomix-output.xml
    compress: true

- name: Upload Repomix output
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: repomix-output
    path: repomix-output.xml
```

## Inicio rápido

Ejecuta este comando en el directorio de tu proyecto:

```bash
npx repomix@latest
```

¡Eso es todo! Encontrarás un archivo `repomix-output.xml` que contiene todo tu repositorio en un formato amigable para la IA.

Luego puedes enviar este archivo a un asistente de IA con un prompt como:

```
Este archivo contiene todos los archivos del repositorio combinados en uno.
Quiero refactorizar el código, así que por favor revísalo primero.
```

La IA analizará todo tu código y proporcionará información completa:

# Servidor MCP

Repomix es compatible con el [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), lo que permite a los asistentes de IA interactuar directamente con tu código. Cuando se ejecuta como servidor MCP, Repomix proporciona herramientas que permiten a los asistentes de IA empaquetar repositorios locales o remotos para su análisis sin necesidad de preparación manual de archivos.

> [!NOTE]  
> Esta es una función experimental que mejoraremos activamente según los comentarios de los usuarios y el uso en el mundo real

## Ejecutar Repomix como servidor MCP

Para ejecutar Repomix como servidor MCP, utiliza la opción `--mcp`:

```bash
repomix --mcp
```

Esto inicia Repomix en modo servidor MCP, haciéndolo disponible para asistentes de IA que soporten el Model Context Protocol.

## Configuración de servidores MCP

Para usar Repomix como servidor MCP con asistentes de IA como Claude, necesitas configurar los ajustes de MCP:

### Para VS Code

Puedes instalar el servidor MCP de Repomix en VS Code usando uno de estos métodos:

1. **Usando la insignia de instalación:**

  [![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-VS_Code?style=flat-square&label=Install%20Server&color=0098FF)](vscode:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22repomix%22%2C%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22repomix%22%2C%22--mcp%22%5D%7D)<br>
  [![Install in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-VS_Code_Insiders?style=flat-square&label=Install%20Server&color=24bfa5)](vscode-insiders:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22repomix%22%2C%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22repomix%22%2C%22--mcp%22%5D%7D)

2. **Usando la línea de comandos:**

  ```bash
  code --add-mcp '{"name":"repomix","command":"npx","args":["-y","repomix","--mcp"]}'
  ```

  Para VS Code Insiders:
  ```bash
  code-insiders --add-mcp '{"name":"repomix","command":"npx","args":["-y","repomix","--mcp"]}'
  ```

### Para Cline (extensión de VS Code)

Edita el archivo `cline_mcp_settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "repomix": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "repomix",
        "--mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Para Cursor

En Cursor, añade un nuevo servidor MCP desde `Cursor Settings` > `MCP` > `+ Add new global MCP server` con una configuración similar a la de Cline.

### Para Claude Desktop

Edita el archivo `claude_desktop_config.json` con una configuración similar a la de Cline.

### Para Claude Code

Para configurar Repomix como servidor MCP en [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview), usa el siguiente comando:

```bash
claude mcp add repomix -- npx -y repomix --mcp
```

Alternativamente, puede usar los **plugins oficiales de Repomix** para una experiencia más conveniente. Los plugins proporcionan comandos en lenguaje natural y configuración más fácil. Consulte la documentación [Plugins de Claude Code](/es/guide/claude-code-plugins) para obtener detalles.

### Usando Docker en lugar de npx

En lugar de usar npx, puedes usar Docker para ejecutar Repomix como servidor MCP:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "repomix-docker": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix",
        "--mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Herramientas MCP disponibles

Cuando se ejecuta como servidor MCP, Repomix proporciona las siguientes herramientas:

### pack_codebase

Esta herramienta empaqueta un directorio de código local en un archivo XML para análisis de IA. Analiza la estructura del código base, extrae contenido de código relevante y genera un informe completo que incluye métricas, árbol de archivos y contenido de código formateado.

**Parámetros:**
- `directory`: (Requerido) Ruta absoluta al directorio a empaquetar
- `compress`: (Opcional, predeterminado: false) Habilita la compresión Tree-sitter para extraer firmas de código esenciales y estructura mientras elimina detalles de implementación. Reduce el uso de tokens en ~70% manteniendo el significado semántico. Generalmente no es necesario ya que grep_repomix_output permite recuperación incremental de contenido. Úsalo solo cuando específicamente necesites el contenido completo del código base para repositorios grandes.
- `includePatterns`: (Opcional) Especifica archivos a incluir usando patrones fast-glob. Múltiples patrones pueden separarse por comas (ej: "**/*.{js,ts}", "src/**,docs/**"). Solo se procesarán archivos coincidentes.
- `ignorePatterns`: (Opcional) Especifica archivos adicionales a excluir usando patrones fast-glob. Múltiples patrones pueden separarse por comas (ej: "test/**,*.spec.js", "node_modules/**,dist/**"). Estos patrones complementan .gitignore y exclusiones integradas.
- `topFilesLength`: (Opcional, predeterminado: 10) Número de archivos más grandes por tamaño para mostrar en el resumen de métricas para análisis del código base.

**Ejemplo:**
```json
{
  "directory": "/path/to/your/project",
  "compress": false,
  "includePatterns": "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md",
  "ignorePatterns": "**/*.log,tmp/",
  "topFilesLength": 10
}
```

### pack_remote_repository

Esta herramienta obtiene, clona y empaqueta un repositorio de GitHub en un archivo XML para análisis de IA. Clona automáticamente el repositorio remoto, analiza su estructura y genera un informe completo.

**Parámetros:**
- `remote`: (Requerido) URL del repositorio de GitHub o formato usuario/repo (ej: "yamadashy/repomix", "https://github.com/user/repo", o "https://github.com/user/repo/tree/branch")
- `compress`: (Opcional, predeterminado: false) Habilita la compresión Tree-sitter para extraer firmas de código esenciales y estructura mientras elimina detalles de implementación. Reduce el uso de tokens en ~70% manteniendo el significado semántico. Generalmente no es necesario ya que grep_repomix_output permite recuperación incremental de contenido. Úsalo solo cuando específicamente necesites el contenido completo del código base para repositorios grandes.
- `includePatterns`: (Opcional) Especifica archivos a incluir usando patrones fast-glob. Múltiples patrones pueden separarse por comas (ej: "**/*.{js,ts}", "src/**,docs/**"). Solo se procesarán archivos coincidentes.
- `ignorePatterns`: (Opcional) Especifica archivos adicionales a excluir usando patrones fast-glob. Múltiples patrones pueden separarse por comas (ej: "test/**,*.spec.js", "node_modules/**,dist/**"). Estos patrones complementan .gitignore y exclusiones integradas.
- `topFilesLength`: (Opcional, predeterminado: 10) Número de archivos más grandes por tamaño para mostrar en el resumen de métricas para análisis del código base.

**Ejemplo:**
```json
{
  "remote": "yamadashy/repomix",
  "compress": false,
  "includePatterns": "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md",
  "ignorePatterns": "**/*.log,tmp/",
  "topFilesLength": 10
}
```

### read_repomix_output

Esta herramienta lee el contenido de un archivo de salida generado por Repomix. Soporta lectura parcial con especificación de rango de líneas para archivos grandes. Esta herramienta está diseñada para entornos donde el acceso directo al sistema de archivos está limitado.

**Parámetros:**
- `outputId`: (Requerido) ID del archivo de salida de Repomix para leer
- `startLine`: (Opcional) Número de línea de inicio (basado en 1, inclusivo). Si no se especifica, lee desde el principio.
- `endLine`: (Opcional) Número de línea final (basado en 1, inclusivo). Si no se especifica, lee hasta el final.

**Características:**
- Diseñado específicamente para entornos basados en web o aplicaciones en sandbox
- Recupera el contenido de salidas generadas previamente usando su ID
- Proporciona acceso seguro al código empaquetado sin requerir acceso al sistema de archivos
- Soporta lectura parcial para archivos grandes

**Ejemplo:**
```json
{
  "outputId": "8f7d3b1e2a9c6054",
  "startLine": 100,
  "endLine": 200
}
```

### grep_repomix_output

Esta herramienta busca patrones en un archivo de salida de Repomix usando funcionalidad similar a grep con sintaxis JavaScript RegExp. Devuelve líneas coincidentes con líneas de contexto opcionales alrededor de las coincidencias.

**Parámetros:**
- `outputId`: (Requerido) ID del archivo de salida de Repomix para buscar
- `pattern`: (Requerido) Patrón de búsqueda (sintaxis de expresión regular JavaScript RegExp)
- `contextLines`: (Opcional, predeterminado: 0) Número de líneas de contexto para mostrar antes y después de cada coincidencia. Sobrescrito por beforeLines/afterLines si se especifica.
- `beforeLines`: (Opcional) Número de líneas de contexto para mostrar antes de cada coincidencia (como grep -B). Tiene precedencia sobre contextLines.
- `afterLines`: (Opcional) Número de líneas de contexto para mostrar después de cada coincidencia (como grep -A). Tiene precedencia sobre contextLines.
- `ignoreCase`: (Opcional, predeterminado: false) Realiza coincidencia insensible a mayúsculas y minúsculas

**Características:**
- Usa sintaxis JavaScript RegExp para coincidencia de patrones potente
- Soporta líneas de contexto para mejor comprensión de las coincidencias
- Permite control separado de líneas de contexto antes/después
- Opciones de búsqueda sensible e insensible a mayúsculas y minúsculas

**Ejemplo:**
```json
{
  "outputId": "8f7d3b1e2a9c6054",
  "pattern": "function\\s+\\w+\\(",
  "contextLines": 3,
  "ignoreCase": false
}
```

### file_system_read_file y file_system_read_directory

El servidor MCP de Repomix proporciona dos herramientas de sistema de archivos que permiten a los asistentes de IA interactuar de manera segura con el sistema de archivos local:

1. `file_system_read_file`
  - Lee contenido de archivos del sistema de archivos local usando rutas absolutas
  - Incluye validación de seguridad integrada para detectar y prevenir acceso a archivos que contienen información sensible
  - Implementa validación de seguridad usando [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint)
  - Previene el acceso a archivos que contienen información sensible (claves API, contraseñas, secretos)
  - Valida rutas absolutas para prevenir ataques de traversal de directorios
  - Devuelve mensajes de error claros para rutas inválidas y problemas de seguridad

2. `file_system_read_directory`
  - Lista contenidos de un directorio usando una ruta absoluta
  - Devuelve una lista formateada mostrando archivos y subdirectorios con indicadores claros
  - Muestra archivos y directorios con indicadores claros (`[FILE]` o `[DIR]`)
  - Proporciona navegación segura de directorios con manejo apropiado de errores
  - Valida rutas y asegura que sean absolutas
  - Útil para explorar estructura de proyectos y entender organización del código base

Ambas herramientas incorporan medidas de seguridad robustas:
- Validación de rutas absolutas para prevenir ataques de traversal de directorios
- Verificaciones de permisos para asegurar derechos de acceso apropiados
- Integración con Secretlint para detección de información sensible
- Mensajes de error claros para depuración y conciencia de seguridad

**Ejemplo:**
```typescript
// Leer un archivo
const fileContent = await tools.file_system_read_file({
  path: '/absolute/path/to/file.txt'
});

// Listar contenidos de directorio
const dirContent = await tools.file_system_read_directory({
  path: '/absolute/path/to/directory'
});
```

Estas herramientas son particularmente útiles cuando los asistentes de IA necesitan:
- Analizar archivos específicos en el código base
- Navegar estructuras de directorios
- Verificar existencia y accesibilidad de archivos
- Asegurar operaciones seguras del sistema de archivos

## Beneficios de usar Repomix como servidor MCP

Usar Repomix como servidor MCP ofrece varias ventajas:

1. **Integración directa**: Los asistentes de IA pueden analizar tu código directamente sin preparación manual de archivos.

# Formatos de salida

Repomix admite cuatro formatos de salida:
- XML (predeterminado)
- Markdown
- JSON
- Texto sin formato

## Formato XML

```bash
repomix --style xml
```

El formato XML está optimizado para el procesamiento de IA:

```xml
Este archivo es una representación fusionada de toda la base de código...

<file_summary>
(Metadatos e instrucciones de IA)
</file_summary>

<directory_structure>
src/

```

### ¿Por qué XML como formato predeterminado?

Repomix utiliza XML como formato de salida predeterminado basándose en investigaciones y pruebas extensas. Esta decisión se fundamenta en evidencia empírica y consideraciones prácticas para el análisis de código asistido por IA.

Nuestra elección de XML está principalmente influenciada por las recomendaciones oficiales de los principales proveedores de IA:
- **Anthropic (Claude)**: Recomienda explícitamente el uso de etiquetas XML para estructurar prompts, declarando que "Claude fue expuesto a tales prompts durante el entrenamiento" ([documentación](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/use-xml-tags))
- **Google (Gemini)**: Recomienda formatos estructurados incluyendo XML para tareas complejas ([documentación](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/structure-prompts))
- **OpenAI (GPT)**: Aboga por el prompting estructurado en escenarios complejos ([anuncio](https://x.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1890147300493914437), [cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5_prompting_guide))

## Formato Markdown

```bash
repomix --style markdown
```

Markdown proporciona un formato legible:

````markdown
Este archivo es una representación fusionada de toda la base de código...

# Resumen de archivos

## Formato JSON

```bash
repomix --style json
```

El formato JSON proporciona salida estructurada y accesible programáticamente con nombres de propiedades en camelCase:

```json
{
  "fileSummary": {
    "generationHeader": "Este archivo es una representación fusionada de toda la base de código, combinada en un solo documento por Repomix.",
    "purpose": "Este archivo contiene una representación empaquetada del contenido completo del repositorio...",
    "fileFormat": "El contenido está organizado de la siguiente manera...",
    "usageGuidelines": "- Este archivo debe tratarse como de solo lectura...",
    "notes": "- Algunos archivos pueden haber sido excluidos según las reglas de .gitignore..."
  },
  "userProvidedHeader": "Texto de encabezado personalizado si se especifica",
  "directoryStructure": "src/
  cli/
    cliOutput.ts
    index.ts
  config/
    configLoader.ts",
  "files": {
    "src/index.js": "// Contenido del archivo aquí",
    "src/utils.js": "// Contenido del archivo aquí"
  },
  "instruction": "Instrucciones personalizadas desde instructionFilePath"
}
```

### Beneficios del formato JSON

El formato JSON es ideal para:
- **Procesamiento programático**: Fácil de analizar y manipular con bibliotecas JSON en cualquier lenguaje de programación
- **Integración de API**: Consumo directo por servicios web y aplicaciones
- **Compatibilidad con herramientas de IA**: Formato estructurado optimizado para aprendizaje automático y sistemas de IA
- **Análisis de datos**: Extracción sencilla de información específica usando herramientas como `jq`

### Trabajando con salida JSON usando `jq`

El formato JSON facilita la extracción programática de información específica. Aquí hay ejemplos comunes:

#### Operaciones básicas de archivos
```bash
# Listar todas las rutas de archivos
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[]'

# Contar el número total de archivos
cat repomix-output.json | jq '.files | keys | length'

# Extraer contenido de archivo específico
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files["README.md"]'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files["src/index.js"]'
```

#### Filtrado y análisis de archivos
```bash
# Encontrar archivos por extensión
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(endswith(".ts"))'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(endswith(".js") or endswith(".ts"))'

# Obtener archivos que contengan texto específico
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | select(.value | contains("function")) | .key'

# Crear lista de archivos con conteo de caracteres
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | "\(.key): \(.value | length) caracteres"'
```

#### Extracción de metadatos
```bash
# Extraer estructura de directorios
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.directoryStructure'

# Obtener información de resumen de archivos
cat repomix-output.json | jq '.fileSummary.purpose'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.fileSummary.generationHeader'

# Extraer encabezado proporcionado por el usuario (si existe)
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.userProvidedHeader // "No se proporcionó encabezado"'

# Obtener instrucciones personalizadas
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.instruction // "No se proporcionaron instrucciones"'
```

#### Análisis avanzado
```bash
# Encontrar archivos más grandes por longitud de contenido
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | [.key, (.value | length)] | @tsv' | sort -k2 -nr | head -10

# Buscar archivos que contengan patrones específicos
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | select(.value | test("import.*react"; "i")) | .key'

# Extraer rutas de archivos que coincidan con múltiples extensiones
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(test("\.(js|ts|jsx|tsx)$"))'
```

## Formato de texto sin formato

```bash
repomix --style plain
```

Estructura de salida:
```text

# Procesamiento de repositorios de GitHub

## Uso básico

Procesar repositorios públicos:
```bash
# Usando URL completo
repomix --remote https://github.com/usuario/repositorio

# Usando la abreviatura de GitHub
repomix --remote usuario/repositorio
```

## Selección de rama y commit

```bash
# Rama específica
repomix --remote usuario/repositorio --remote-branch main

# Etiqueta
repomix --remote usuario/repositorio --remote-branch v1.0.0

# Hash de commit
repomix --remote usuario/repositorio --remote-branch 935b695
```

## Requisitos

- Git debe estar instalado
- Conexión a Internet
- Acceso de lectura al repositorio

## Control de salida

```bash
# Ubicación de salida personalizada
repomix --remote usuario/repositorio -o salida-personalizada.xml

# Con formato XML
repomix --remote usuario/repositorio --style xml

# Eliminar comentarios
repomix --remote usuario/repositorio --remove-comments
```

## Uso de Docker

```bash
# Procesar y generar la salida en el directorio actual
docker run -v .:/app -it --rm ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix \
  --remote usuario/repositorio

# Generar la salida en un directorio específico
docker run -v ./output:/app -it --rm ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix \
  --remote usuario/repositorio
```

## Problemas comunes

### Problemas de acceso
- Asegúrate de que el repositorio sea público
- Comprueba la instalación de Git
- Verifica la conexión a Internet

### Repositorios grandes
- Usa `--include` para seleccionar rutas específicas
- Habilita `--remove-comments`
- Procesa las ramas por separado
`````

## File: website/client/src/es/guide/security.md
`````markdown
# Seguridad

## Función de verificación de seguridad

Repomix utiliza [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint) para detectar información sensible en tus archivos:
- Claves de API
- Tokens de acceso
- Credenciales
- Claves privadas
- Variables de entorno

## Configuración

Las verificaciones de seguridad están habilitadas de forma predeterminada.

Deshabilitar a través de CLI:
```bash
repomix --no-security-check
```

O en `repomix.config.json`:
```json
{
  "security": {
    "enableSecurityCheck": false
  }
}
```

## Medidas de seguridad

1. **Manejo de archivos binarios**: Los contenidos de archivos binarios se excluyen de la salida, pero sus rutas se listan en la estructura de directorios para una vista completa del repositorio
2. **Compatible con Git**: Respeta los patrones de `.gitignore`
3. **Detección automatizada**: Busca problemas de seguridad comunes:
    - Credenciales de AWS
    - Cadenas de conexión de bases de datos
    - Tokens de autenticación
    - Claves privadas

## Cuando la verificación de seguridad encuentra problemas

Ejemplo de salida:
```bash
🔍 Verificación de seguridad:
──────────────────
2 archivo(s) sospechoso(s) detectado(s) y excluido(s):
1. config/credentials.json
  - Se encontró la clave de acceso de AWS
2. .env.local
  - Se encontró la contraseña de la base de datos
```

## Mejores prácticas

1. Siempre revisa la salida antes de compartirla
2. Usa `.repomixignore` para rutas sensibles
3. Mantén las verificaciones de seguridad habilitadas
4. Elimina los archivos sensibles del repositorio

## Reportar problemas de seguridad

¿Encontraste una vulnerabilidad de seguridad? Por favor:
1. No abras un issue público
2. Envía un correo electrónico a: koukun0120@gmail.com
3. O usa [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/security/advisories/new)

`````

## File: website/client/src/es/guide/usage.md
`````markdown
# Uso básico

## Inicio rápido

Empaqueta todo tu repositorio:
```bash
repomix
```

## Casos de uso comunes

### Empaquetar directorios específicos
```bash
repomix ruta/al/directorio
```

### Incluir archivos específicos
Usa [patrones glob](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax):
```bash
repomix --include "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md"
```

### Excluir archivos
```bash
repomix --ignore "**/*.log,tmp/"
```

### Repositorios remotos
```bash
# Usando la URL de GitHub
repomix --remote https://github.com/usuario/repositorio

# Usando la abreviatura
repomix --remote usuario/repositorio

# Rama/etiqueta/commit específico
repomix --remote usuario/repositorio --remote-branch main
repomix --remote usuario/repositorio --remote-branch 935b695
```

### Entrada de lista de archivos (stdin)

Pasa rutas de archivos a través de stdin para máxima flexibilidad:

```bash
# Usando el comando find
find src -name "*.ts" -type f | repomix --stdin

# Usando git para obtener archivos rastreados
git ls-files "*.ts" | repomix --stdin

# Usando ripgrep (rg) para encontrar archivos
rg --files --type ts | repomix --stdin

# Usando grep para encontrar archivos que contienen contenido específico
grep -l "TODO" **/*.ts | repomix --stdin

# Usando ripgrep para encontrar archivos con contenido específico
rg -l "TODO|FIXME" --type ts | repomix --stdin

# Usando sharkdp/fd para encontrar archivos
fd -e ts | repomix --stdin

# Usando fzf para seleccionar de todos los archivos
fzf -m | repomix --stdin

# Selección interactiva de archivos con fzf
find . -name "*.ts" -type f | fzf -m | repomix --stdin

# Usando ls con patrones glob
ls src/**/*.ts | repomix --stdin

# Desde un archivo que contiene rutas de archivos
cat file-list.txt | repomix --stdin

# Entrada directa con echo
echo -e "src/index.ts\nsrc/utils.ts" | repomix --stdin
```

La opción `--stdin` te permite canalizar una lista de rutas de archivos a Repomix, brindando máxima flexibilidad en la selección de qué archivos empaquetar.

Cuando se usa `--stdin`, los archivos especificados se agregan efectivamente a los patrones de inclusión. Esto significa que el comportamiento normal de inclusión e ignorar sigue aplicando - los archivos especificados vía stdin aún serán excluidos si coinciden con patrones de ignorar.

> [!NOTE]
> Cuando uses `--stdin`, las rutas de archivos pueden ser relativas o absolutas, y Repomix manejará automáticamente la resolución de rutas y la eliminación de duplicados.

### Compresión de código

```bash
repomix --compress

# También puedes usarlo con repositorios remotos:
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix --compress
```

### Integración con Git

Incluye información de Git para proporcionar contexto de desarrollo al análisis de IA:

```bash
# Incluir diffs de git (cambios sin commit)
repomix --include-diffs

# Incluir logs de commits de git (últimos 50 commits por defecto)
repomix --include-logs

# Incluir número específico de commits
repomix --include-logs --include-logs-count 10

# Incluir tanto diffs como logs
repomix --include-diffs --include-logs
```

Esto añade contexto valioso sobre:
- **Cambios recientes**: Los diffs de Git muestran modificaciones sin commit
- **Patrones de desarrollo**: Los logs de Git revelan qué archivos típicamente se cambian juntos
- **Historial de commits**: Los mensajes de commit recientes proporcionan información sobre el enfoque de desarrollo
- **Relaciones entre archivos**: Entender qué archivos se modifican en los mismos commits

### Optimización del conteo de tokens

Entender la distribución de tokens de tu base de código es crucial para optimizar las interacciones con IA. Usa la opción `--token-count-tree` para visualizar el uso de tokens en todo tu proyecto:

```bash
repomix --token-count-tree
```

Esto muestra una vista jerárquica de tu base de código con conteos de tokens:

```
🔢 Token Count Tree:
────────────────────
└── src/ (70,925 tokens)
    ├── cli/ (12,714 tokens)
    │   ├── actions/ (7,546 tokens)
    │   └── reporters/ (990 tokens)
    └── core/ (41,600 tokens)
        ├── file/ (10,098 tokens)
        └── output/ (5,808 tokens)
```

También puedes establecer un umbral mínimo de tokens para enfocarte en archivos más grandes:

```bash
repomix --token-count-tree 1000  # Solo mostrar archivos/directorios con 1000+ tokens
```

Esto te ayuda a:
- **Identificar archivos pesados en tokens** - que podrían exceder los límites de contexto de IA
- **Optimizar la selección de archivos** - usando patrones `--include` e `--ignore`
- **Planificar estrategias de compresión** - dirigiéndose a los mayores contribuyentes
- **Equilibrar contenido vs contexto** - al preparar código para análisis de IA

## Formatos de salida

### XML (predeterminado)
```bash
repomix --style xml
```

### Markdown
```bash
repomix --style markdown
```

### JSON
```bash
repomix --style json
```

### Texto sin formato
```bash
repomix --style plain
```

## Opciones adicionales

### Eliminar comentarios
```bash
repomix --remove-comments
```

### Mostrar números de línea
```bash
repomix --output-show-line-numbers
```

### Copiar al portapapeles
```bash
repomix --copy
```

### Deshabilitar la verificación de seguridad
```bash
repomix --no-security-check
```

## Configuración

Inicializar el archivo de configuración:
```bash

# Utiliser Repomix comme bibliothèque

En plus d'utiliser Repomix comme outil CLI, vous pouvez intégrer ses fonctionnalités directement dans vos applications Node.js.

## Installation

Installez Repomix comme dépendance dans votre projet :

```bash
npm install repomix
```

## Utilisation de base

La façon la plus simple d'utiliser Repomix est via la fonction `runCli`, qui fournit les mêmes fonctionnalités que l'interface en ligne de commande :

```javascript
import { runCli, type CliOptions } from 'repomix';

// Traiter le répertoire courant avec des options personnalisées
async function packProject() {
  const options = {
    output: 'output.xml',
    style: 'xml',
    compress: true,
    quiet: true
  } as CliOptions;
  
  const result = await runCli(['.'], process.cwd(), options);
  return result.packResult;
}
```

Le `result.packResult` contient des informations sur les fichiers traités, notamment :
- `totalFiles` : Nombre de fichiers traités
- `totalCharacters` : Nombre total de caractères
- `totalTokens` : Nombre total de tokens (utile pour les limites de contexte des LLM)
- `fileCharCounts` : Nombre de caractères par fichier
- `fileTokenCounts` : Nombre de tokens par fichier

## Traitement des dépôts distants

Vous pouvez cloner et traiter un dépôt distant :

```javascript
import { runCli, type CliOptions } from 'repomix';

// Cloner et traiter un dépôt GitHub
async function processRemoteRepo(repoUrl) {
  const options = {
    remote: repoUrl,
    output: 'output.xml',
    compress: true
  } as CliOptions;
  
  return await runCli(['.'], process.cwd(), options);
}
```

## Utilisation des composants principaux

Pour un contrôle plus précis, vous pouvez utiliser directement les API de bas niveau de Repomix :

```javascript
import { searchFiles, collectFiles, processFiles, TokenCounter } from 'repomix';

async function analyzeFiles(directory) {
  // Rechercher et collecter les fichiers
  const { filePaths } = await searchFiles(directory, { /* configuration */ });
  const rawFiles = await collectFiles(filePaths, directory);
  const processedFiles = await processFiles(rawFiles, { /* configuration */ });
  
  // Compter les tokens
  const tokenCounter = new TokenCounter('o200k_base');
  
  // Retourner les résultats d'analyse
  return processedFiles.map(file => ({
    path: file.path,
    tokens: tokenCounter.countTokens(file.content)
  }));
}
```

## Exemple concret

Le site web de Repomix ([repomix.com](https://repomix.com)) utilise Repomix comme bibliothèque pour traiter les dépôts distants. Vous pouvez consulter l'implémentation dans [website/server/src/remoteRepo.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/....ts).

# Meilleures pratiques de développement assisté par IA : De mon expérience

Bien que je n'aie pas encore réussi à mener à bien un projet à grande échelle en utilisant l'IA, je souhaite partager ce que j'ai appris jusqu'à présent de mon expérience de travail avec l'IA dans le développement.

## Approche de développement de base

Lorsque l'on travaille avec l'IA, tenter d'implémenter toutes les fonctionnalités en une fois peut conduire à des problèmes inattendus et à une stagnation du projet. C'est pourquoi il est plus efficace de commencer par les fonctionnalités principales et de construire chaque fonctionnalité une par une, en s'assurant d'une implémentation solide avant d'avancer.

### La puissance du code existant

Cette approche est efficace car l'implémentation des fonctionnalités principales vous permet de matérialiser votre design idéal et votre style de codage à travers du code réel. La manière la plus efficace de communiquer votre vision du projet est à travers du code qui reflète vos standards et préférences.

En commençant par les fonctionnalités principales et en s'assurant que chaque composant fonctionne correctement avant de passer à la suite, l'ensemble du projet maintient sa cohérence, rendant plus facile pour l'IA de générer du code plus approprié.

## L'approche modulaire

La décomposition du code en modules plus petits est cruciale. D'après mon expérience, maintenir les fichiers autour de 250 lignes de code rend plus facile de donner des instructions claires à l'IA et rend le processus d'essai-erreur plus efficace. Bien que le nombre de tokens serait une métrique plus précise, le nombre de lignes est plus pratique pour les développeurs humains, nous utilisons donc cela comme ligne directrice.

Cette modularisation ne consiste pas seulement à séparer les composants frontend, backend et base de données - il s'agit de décomposer les fonctionnalités à un niveau beaucoup plus fin. Par exemple, au sein d'une même fonctionnalité, vous pourriez séparer la validation, la gestion des erreurs et d'autres fonctionnalités spécifiques en modules distincts. Bien sûr, la séparation de haut niveau est également importante, et implémenter cette approche modulaire progressivement aide à maintenir des instructions claires et permet à l'IA de générer du code plus approprié. Cette approche est efficace non seulement pour l'IA mais aussi pour les développeurs humains.

## Assurer la qualité par les tests

Je considère que les tests sont cruciaux dans le développement assisté par IA. Les tests servent non seulement de mesures d'assurance qualité mais aussi de documentation qui démontre clairement les intentions du code. Lorsque vous demandez à l'IA d'implémenter de nouvelles fonctionnalités, le code de test existant agit efficacement comme un document de spécification.

Les tests sont également un excellent outil pour valider l'exactitude du code généré par l'IA. Par exemple, lorsque vous faites implémenter une nouvelle fonctionnalité pour un module par l'IA, écrire des cas de test au préalable vous permet d'évaluer objectivement si le code généré se comporte comme prévu. Cela s'aligne bien avec les principes du Développement Piloté par les Tests (TDD) et est particulièrement efficace lors de la collaboration avec l'IA.

## Équilibrer planification et implémentation

Avant d'implémenter des fonctionnalités à grande échelle, je recommande de d'abord discuter du plan avec l'IA. Organiser les exigences et réfléchir à l'architecture conduit à une implémentation plus fluide. Une bonne pratique consiste à compiler d'abord les exigences, puis passer à une session de chat séparée pour le travail d'implémentation.

Il est essentiel que les humains examinent la sortie de l'IA et fassent des ajustements si nécessaire. Bien que la qualité du code généré par l'IA soit généralement modérée, cela accélère tout de même le développement par rapport à l'écriture de tout à partir de zéro.

## Conclusion

En suivant ces pratiques, vous pouvez exploiter les points forts de l'IA tout en construisant une base de code cohérente et de haute qualité. Même lorsque votre projet grandit en taille, chaque composant reste bien défini et gérable.

`````markdown
# Génération d'Agent Skills

Repomix peut générer une sortie au format [Claude Agent Skills](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills), créant un répertoire structuré de Skills qui peut être utilisé comme référence de base de code réutilisable pour les assistants IA.

Cette fonctionnalité est particulièrement puissante lorsque vous souhaitez référencer des implémentations de dépôts distants. En générant des Skills à partir de projets open source, vous pouvez facilement demander à Claude de référencer des modèles ou implémentations spécifiques tout en travaillant sur votre propre code.

Au lieu de générer un seul fichier empaqueté, la génération de Skills crée un répertoire structuré avec plusieurs fichiers de référence optimisés pour la compréhension de l'IA et la recherche compatible avec grep.

> [!NOTE]
> Il s'agit d'une fonctionnalité expérimentale. Le format de sortie et les options peuvent changer dans les futures versions en fonction des retours utilisateurs.

## Utilisation de Base

Générer des Skills depuis votre répertoire local :

```bash
# Générer des Skills depuis le répertoire actuel
repomix --skill-generate

# Générer avec un nom de Skills personnalisé
repomix --skill-generate my-project-reference

# Générer depuis un répertoire spécifique
repomix path/to/directory --skill-generate

# Générer depuis un dépôt distant
repomix --remote https://github.com/user/repo --skill-generate
```

## Sélection de l'Emplacement des Skills

Lorsque vous exécutez la commande, Repomix vous demande de choisir où sauvegarder les Skills :

1. **Personal Skills** (`~/.claude/skills/`) - Disponible pour tous les projets sur votre machine
2. **Project Skills** (`.claude/skills/`) - Partagé avec votre équipe via git

Si le répertoire Skills existe déjà, on vous demandera de confirmer l'écrasement.

> [!TIP]
> Lors de la génération de Project Skills, envisagez de les ajouter à `.gitignore` pour éviter de commiter de gros fichiers :
> ```gitignore
> .claude/skills/repomix-reference-*/
> ```

## Structure Générée

Les Skills sont générés avec la structure suivante :

```text
.claude/skills/<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md                    # Métadonnées principales et documentation des Skills
└── references/
    ├── summary.md              # But, format et statistiques
    ├── project-structure.md    # Arborescence avec nombre de lignes
    ├── files.md                # Tout le contenu des fichiers (compatible grep)
    └── tech-stack.md           # Langages, frameworks, dépendances
```

### Descriptions des Fichiers

#### SKILL.md

Le fichier principal des Skills contient :
- Nom des Skills, description et informations du projet
- Nombre de fichiers, de lignes et de tokens
- Aperçu de l'utilisation des Skills
- Emplacements des fichiers et explication du format
- Cas d'utilisation courants et conseils

#### references/summary.md

Contient :
- **But** : Explique qu'il s'agit d'une base de code de référence pour utilisation par l'IA
- **Structure des Fichiers** : Documente le contenu de chaque fichier de référence
- **Directives d'Utilisation** : Comment utiliser efficacement les Skills
- **Statistiques** : Répartition par type de fichier, langage et plus gros fichiers

#### references/project-structure.md

Arborescence avec nombre de lignes par fichier pour une découverte facile :

```text
src/
  index.ts (42 lines)
  utils/
    helpers.ts (128 lines)
    math.ts (87 lines)
```

#### references/files.md

Tout le contenu des fichiers avec en-têtes de coloration syntaxique, optimisé pour la recherche compatible grep :

````markdown
## File: src/index.ts
```typescript
import { sum } from './utils/helpers';

export function main() {
  console.log(sum(1, 2));
}
```
````

#### references/tech-stack.md

Stack technologique auto-détecté depuis les fichiers de dépendances :
- **Langages** : TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, etc.
- **Frameworks** : React, Next.js, Express, Django, etc.
- **Versions Runtime** : Node.js, Python, Go, etc.
- **Gestionnaire de Paquets** : npm, pnpm, poetry, etc.
- **Dépendances** : Toutes les dépendances directes et de développement
- **Fichiers de Configuration** : Tous les fichiers de configuration détectés

Détecté depuis des fichiers comme : `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `.nvmrc`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.

## Noms de Skills Auto-Générés

Si aucun nom n'est fourni, Repomix en génère automatiquement un avec ce modèle :

```bash
repomix src/ --skill-generate                # → repomix-reference-src
repomix --remote user/repo --skill-generate  # → repomix-reference-repo
repomix --skill-generate CustomName          # → custom-name (normalisé en kebab-case)
```

Les noms de Skills sont :
- Convertis en kebab-case (minuscules, séparés par des tirets)
- Limités à 64 caractères maximum
- Protégés contre le path traversal

## Intégration avec les Options Repomix

La génération de Skills respecte toutes les options standard de Repomix :

```bash
# Générer des Skills avec filtrage de fichiers
repomix --skill-generate --include "src/**/*.ts" --ignore "**/*.test.ts"

# Générer des Skills avec compression
repomix --skill-generate --compress

# Générer des Skills depuis un dépôt distant
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix --skill-generate

# Générer des Skills avec des options de format de sortie spécifiques
repomix --skill-generate --remove-comments --remove-empty-lines
```

### Skills Documentation Uniquement

En utilisant `--include`, vous pouvez générer des Skills contenant uniquement la documentation d'un dépôt GitHub. C'est utile quand vous voulez que Claude référence une documentation spécifique de bibliothèque ou framework pendant que vous travaillez sur votre code :

```bash
# Documentation Claude Code Action
repomix --remote https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action --include docs --skill-generate

# Documentation Vite
repomix --remote https://github.com/vitejs/vite --include docs --skill-generate

# Documentation React
repomix --remote https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev --include src/content --skill-generate
```

## Limitations

L'option `--skill-generate` ne peut pas être utilisée avec :
- `--stdout` - La sortie Skills nécessite l'écriture sur le système de fichiers
- `--copy` - La sortie Skills est un répertoire, non copiable dans le presse-papiers

## Utilisation des Skills Générés

Une fois générés, vous pouvez utiliser les Skills avec Claude :

1. **Claude Code** : Les Skills sont automatiquement disponibles s'ils sont sauvegardés dans `~/.claude/skills/` ou `.claude/skills/`
2. **Claude Web** : Téléchargez le répertoire Skills vers Claude pour l'analyse de base de code
3. **Partage d'Équipe** : Commitez `.claude/skills/` dans votre dépôt pour un accès de toute l'équipe

## Exemple de Workflow

### Créer une Bibliothèque de Référence Personnelle

```bash
# Cloner et analyser un projet open source intéressant
repomix --remote facebook/react --skill-generate react-reference

# Les Skills sont sauvegardés dans ~/.claude/skills/react-reference/
# Maintenant vous pouvez référencer la base de code de React dans n'importe quelle conversation Claude
```

### Documentation de Projet d'Équipe

```bash
# Dans votre répertoire de projet
cd my-project

# Générer des Skills pour votre équipe
repomix --skill-generate

# Choisissez "Project Skills" quand demandé
# Les Skills sont sauvegardés dans .claude/skills/repomix-reference-my-project/

# Commitez et partagez avec votre équipe
git add .claude/skills/
git commit -m "Add codebase reference Skills"
```

## File: website/client/src/fr/guide/code-compress.md
`````markdown
# Compression de code

La compression de code est une fonctionnalité puissante qui extrait intelligemment les structures de code essentielles tout en supprimant les détails d'implémentation. C'est particulièrement utile pour réduire le nombre de tokens tout en conservant les informations structurelles importantes de votre base de code.

> [!NOTE]  
> Il s'agit d'une fonctionnalité expérimentale que nous améliorerons activement en fonction des retours utilisateurs et de l'usage réel

## Utilisation de base

Activez la compression de code en utilisant l'option `--compress`:

```bash
repomix --compress
```

Vous pouvez également l'utiliser avec des dépôts distants:

```bash
repomix --remote user/repo --compress
```

## Fonctionnement

L'algorithme de compression traite le code en utilisant l'analyse tree-sitter pour extraire et préserver les éléments structurels essentiels tout en supprimant les détails d'implémentation.

La compression préserve:
- Les signatures de fonctions et de méthodes
- Les définitions d'interfaces et de types
- Les structures de classes et leurs propriétés
- Les éléments structurels importants

Tout en supprimant:
- Les implémentations de fonctions et de méthodes
- Les détails de logique des boucles et conditions
- Les déclarations de variables internes
- Le code spécifique à l'implémentation

### Exemple

Code TypeScript original:

```typescript
import { ShoppingItem } from './shopping-item';
/**
 * Calculate the total price of shopping items
 */
const calculateTotal = (
  items: ShoppingItem[]
) => {
  let total = 0;
  for (const item of items) {
    total += item.price * item.quantity;
  }
  return total;
}
// Shopping item interface
interface Item {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  quantity: number;
}
```

Après compression:

```typescript
import { ShoppingItem } from './shopping-item';
⋮----
/**
 * Calculate the total price of shopping items
 */
const calculateTotal = (
  items: ShoppingItem[]
) => {
⋮----
// Shopping item interface
interface Item {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  quantity: number;
}
```

## Configuration

Vous pouvez activer la compression dans votre fichier de configuration:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "compress": true
  }
}
```

## Cas d'utilisation

La compression de code est particulièrement utile pour:
- Analyser la structure et l'architecture du code
- Réduire le nombre de tokens pour le traitement par les LLM
- Créer une documentation de haut niveau
- Comprendre les motifs de code et les signatures
- Partager les conceptions d'API et d'interfaces

## Options associées

Vous pouvez combiner la compression avec d'autres options:
- `--remove-comments`: Supprimer les commentaires du code
- `--remove-empty-lines`: Supprimer les lignes vides
- `--output-show-line-numbers`: Ajouter les numéros de ligne à la sortie

# Suppression des commentaires

Repomix peut automatiquement supprimer les commentaires de votre base de code lors de la génération du fichier de sortie. Cela peut aider à réduire le bruit et à se concentrer sur le code réel.

## Utilisation

Pour activer la suppression des commentaires, définissez l'option `removeComments` sur `true` dans votre `repomix.config.json`:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "removeComments": true
  }
}
```

## Langages pris en charge

Repomix prend en charge la suppression des commentaires pour une large gamme de langages de programmation, notamment:

- JavaScript/TypeScript (`//`, `/* */`)
- Python (`#`, `"""`, `'''`)
- Java (`//`, `/* */`)
- C/C++ (`//`, `/* */`)
- HTML (`<!-- -->`)
- CSS (`/* */`)
- Et bien d'autres...

## Exemple

Considérons le code JavaScript suivant:

```javascript
// Ceci est un commentaire sur une ligne
function test() {
  /* Ceci est un
     commentaire sur
     plusieurs lignes */
  return true;
}
```

Avec la suppression des commentaires activée, la sortie sera:

```javascript
function test() {
  return true;
}
```

## Remarques

- La suppression des commentaires est effectuée avant les autres étapes de traitement, comme l'ajout de numéros de ligne.
- Certains commentaires, comme les commentaires JSDoc, peuvent être préservés selon le langage et le contexte.

# Configuration

Repomix peut être configuré à l'aide d'un fichier de configuration ou d'options en ligne de commande. Le fichier de configuration vous permet de personnaliser divers aspects du traitement et de la sortie de votre base de code.

## Formats de fichiers de configuration

Repomix prend en charge plusieurs formats de fichiers de configuration pour plus de flexibilité et de facilité d'utilisation.

Repomix recherchera automatiquement les fichiers de configuration dans l'ordre de priorité suivant :

1. **TypeScript** (`repomix.config.ts`, `repomix.config.mts`, `repomix.config.cts`)
2. **JavaScript/ES Module** (`repomix.config.js`, `repomix.config.mjs`, `repomix.config.cjs`)
3. **JSON** (`repomix.config.json5`, `repomix.config.jsonc`, `repomix.config.json`)

### Configuration JSON

Créez un fichier de configuration dans votre répertoire de projet :
```bash
repomix --init
```

Cela créera un fichier `repomix.config.json` avec les paramètres par défaut. Vous pouvez également créer un fichier de configuration global qui sera utilisé comme solution de repli lorsqu'aucune configuration locale n'est trouvée :

```bash
repomix --init --global
```

### Configuration TypeScript

Les fichiers de configuration TypeScript offrent la meilleure expérience de développement avec une vérification complète des types et un support IDE.

**Installation :**

Pour utiliser la configuration TypeScript ou JavaScript avec `defineConfig`, vous devez installer Repomix en tant que dépendance de développement :

```bash
npm install -D repomix
```

**Exemple :**

```typescript
// repomix.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'repomix';

export default defineConfig({
  output: {
    filePath: 'output.xml',
    style: 'xml',
    removeComments: true,
  },
  ignore: {
    customPatterns: ['**/node_modules/**', '**/dist/**'],
  },
});
```

**Avantages :**
- ✅ Vérification complète des types TypeScript dans votre IDE
- ✅ Excellente autocomplétion et IntelliSense de l'IDE
- ✅ Utilisation de valeurs dynamiques (horodatages, variables d'environnement, etc.)

**Exemple de valeurs dynamiques :**

```typescript
// repomix.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'repomix';

// Générer un nom de fichier basé sur l'horodatage
const timestamp = new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 19).replace(/[:.]/g, '-');

export default defineConfig({
  output: {
    filePath: `output-${timestamp}.xml`,
    style: 'xml',
  },
});
```

### Configuration JavaScript

Les fichiers de configuration JavaScript fonctionnent de la même manière que TypeScript, en prenant en charge `defineConfig` et les valeurs dynamiques.

## Options de configuration

Voir [tiktoken model.py](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken/blob/main/tiktoken/model.py#L24) pour plus de détails. | `"o200k_base"`         |

Le fichier de configuration prend en charge la syntaxe [JSON5](https://json5.org/), qui permet :
- Les commentaires (à la fois sur une seule ligne et sur plusieurs lignes)
- Les virgules finales dans les objets et les tableaux
- Les noms de propriétés non entre guillemets
- Une syntaxe de chaîne plus souple

## Validation de schéma

Vous pouvez activer la validation de schéma pour votre fichier de configuration en ajoutant la propriété `$schema` :

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://repomix.com/schemas/latest/schema.json",
  "output": {
    "filePath": "repomix-output.md",
    "style": "markdown"
  }
}
```

Cela fournit l'auto-complétion et la validation dans les éditeurs qui prennent en charge le schéma JSON.

## Exemple de fichier de configuration

Voici un exemple de fichier de configuration complet (`repomix.config.json`) :

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://repomix.com/schemas/latest/schema.json",
  "input": {
    "maxFileSize": 50000000
  },
  "output": {
    "filePath": "repomix-output.xml",
    "style": "xml",
    "parsableStyle": false,
    "compress": false,
    "headerText": "Informations d'en-tête personnalisées pour le fichier compressé.",
    "fileSummary": true,
    "directoryStructure": true,
    "files": true,
    "removeComments": false,
    "removeEmptyLines": false,
    "topFilesLength": 5,
    "showLineNumbers": false,
    "truncateBase64": false,
    "copyToClipboard": false,
    "includeEmptyDirectories": false,
    "git": {
      "sortByChanges": true,
      "sortByChangesMaxCommits": 100,
      "includeDiffs": false,
      "includeLogs": false,
      "includeLogsCount": 50
    }
  },
  "include": ["**/*"],
  "ignore": {
    "useGitignore": true,
    "useDefaultPatterns": true,
    // Les motifs peuvent également être spécifiés dans .repomixignore
    "customPatterns": [
      "additional-folder",
      "**/*.log"
    ],
  },
  "security": {
    "enableSecurityCheck": true
  },
  "tokenCount": {
    "encoding": "o200k_base"
  }
}
```

## Emplacements des fichiers de configuration

Repomix recherche les fichiers de configuration dans l'ordre suivant :
1. Fichier de configuration local dans le répertoire courant (ordre de priorité : TS > JS > JSON)
   - TypeScript : `repomix.config.ts`, `repomix.config.mts`, `repomix.config.cts`
   - JavaScript : `repomix.config.js`, `repomix.config.mjs`, `repomix.config.cjs`
   - JSON : `repomix.config.json5`, `repomix.config.jsonc`, `repomix.config.json`
2. Fichier de configuration global (ordre de priorité : TS > JS > JSON)
   - Windows :
     - TypeScript : `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.ts`, `.mts`, `.cts`
     - JavaScript : `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`
     - JSON : `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.json5`, `.jsonc`, `.json`
   - macOS/Linux :
     - TypeScript : `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.ts`, `.mts`, `.cts`
     - JavaScript : `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`
     - JSON : `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.json5`, `.jsonc`, `.json`

Les options en ligne de commande ont la priorité sur les paramètres du fichier de configuration.

## Motifs d'inclusion

Repomix prend en charge la spécification de fichiers à inclure en utilisant des [motifs glob](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax). Cela permet une sélection de fichiers plus flexible et puissante :

- Utilisez `**/*.js` pour inclure tous les fichiers JavaScript dans n'importe quel répertoire
- Utilisez `src/**/*` pour inclure tous les fichiers dans le répertoire `src` et ses sous-répertoires
- Combinez plusieurs motifs comme `["src/**/*.js", "**/*.md"]` pour inclure les fichiers JavaScript dans `src` et tous les fichiers Markdown

Vous pouvez spécifier des motifs d'inclusion dans votre fichier de configuration :

```json
{
  "include": ["src/**/*", "tests/**/*.test.js"]
}
```

Ou utilisez l'option en ligne de commande `--include` pour un filtrage ponctuel.

## Motifs d'ignorance

Repomix offre plusieurs méthodes pour définir des motifs d'ignorance afin d'exclure des fichiers ou répertoires spécifiques pendant le processus d'empaquetage :

- **.gitignore** : Par défaut, les motifs listés dans les fichiers `.gitignore` de votre projet et `.git/info/exclude` sont utilisés. Ce comportement peut être contrôlé avec le paramètre `ignore.useGitignore` ou l'option CLI `--no-gitignore`.
- **.ignore** : Vous pouvez utiliser un fichier `.ignore` à la racine de votre projet, suivant le même format que `.gitignore`. Ce fichier est respecté par des outils comme ripgrep et the silver searcher, réduisant le besoin de maintenir plusieurs fichiers d'ignorance. Ce comportement peut être contrôlé avec le paramètre `ignore.useDotIgnore` ou l'option CLI `--no-dot-ignore`.
- **Motifs par défaut** : Repomix inclut une liste par défaut de fichiers et répertoires couramment exclus (par exemple, node_modules, .git, fichiers binaires). Cette fonctionnalité peut être contrôlée avec le paramètre `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` ou l'option CLI `--no-default-patterns`. Veuillez consulter [defaultIgnore.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/src/config/defaultIgnore.ts) pour plus de détails.
- **.repomixignore** : Vous pouvez créer un fichier `.repomixignore` à la racine de votre projet pour définir des motifs d'ignorance spécifiques à Repomix. Ce fichier suit le même format que `.gitignore`.
- **Motifs personnalisés** : Des motifs d'ignorance supplémentaires peuvent être spécifiés en utilisant l'option `ignore.customPatterns` dans le fichier de configuration. Vous pouvez remplacer ce paramètre avec l'option en ligne de commande `-i, --ignore`.

**Ordre de priorité** (du plus élevé au plus bas) :

1. Motifs personnalisés (`ignore.customPatterns`)
2. Fichiers d'ignorance (`.repomixignore`, `.ignore`, `.gitignore`, et `.git/info/exclude`) :
   - Lorsqu'ils sont dans des répertoires imbriqués, les fichiers dans les répertoires plus profonds ont une priorité plus élevée
   - Lorsqu'ils sont dans le même répertoire, ces fichiers sont fusionnés sans ordre particulier
3. Motifs par défaut (si `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` est vrai et `--no-default-patterns` n'est pas utilisé)

Cette approche permet une configuration flexible de l'exclusion de fichiers en fonction des besoins de votre projet. Elle aide à optimiser la taille du fichier empaqueté généré en garantissant l'exclusion des fichiers sensibles à la sécurité et des gros fichiers binaires, tout en empêchant la fuite d'informations confidentielles.

**Remarque :** Les fichiers binaires ne sont pas inclus dans la sortie empaquetée par défaut, mais leurs chemins sont listés dans la section "Structure du dépôt" du fichier de sortie. Cela fournit un aperçu complet de la structure du dépôt tout en maintenant le fichier empaqueté efficace et basé sur du texte. Voir [Gestion des fichiers binaires](#gestion-des-fichiers-binaires) pour plus de détails.

Exemple de `.repomixignore` :
```text
# Répertoires de cache
.cache/
tmp/

# Sorties de build
dist/
build/

# Logs
*.log
```

## Motifs d'ignorance par défaut

Lorsque `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` est vrai, Repomix ignore automatiquement les motifs courants :
```text
node_modules/**
.git/**
coverage/**
dist/**
```

Pour la liste complète, voir [defaultIgnore.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/src/config/defaultIgnore.ts)

## Gestion des fichiers binaires

Les fichiers binaires (tels que les images, les PDF, les binaires compilés, les archives, etc.) sont traités de manière spéciale pour maintenir une sortie efficace basée sur du texte :

- **Contenus de fichiers** : Les fichiers binaires **ne sont pas inclus** dans la sortie empaquetée pour garder le fichier basé sur du texte et efficace pour le traitement IA
- **Structure des répertoires** : Les chemins de fichiers binaires **sont listés** dans la section de structure des répertoires, fournissant un aperçu complet de votre dépôt

Cette approche garantit que vous obtenez une vue complète de la structure de votre dépôt tout en maintenant une sortie efficace basée sur du texte optimisée pour la consommation par l'IA.

**Exemple :**

Si votre dépôt contient `logo.png` et `app.jar` :
- Ils apparaîtront dans la section Structure des répertoires
- Leurs contenus ne seront pas inclus dans la section Fichiers

**Sortie de structure des répertoires :**
```
src/
  index.ts
  utils.ts
assets/
  logo.png
build/
  app.jar
```

De cette façon, les outils d'IA peuvent comprendre que ces fichiers binaires existent dans la structure de votre projet sans traiter leurs contenus binaires.

**Remarque :** Vous pouvez contrôler le seuil de taille maximale des fichiers en utilisant l'option de configuration `input.maxFileSize` (par défaut : 50MB). Les fichiers plus grands que cette limite seront entièrement ignorés.

## Fonctionnalités avancées

### Compression du code

La fonction de compression du code, activée avec `output.compress: true`, utilise [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) pour extraire intelligemment les structures de code essentielles tout en supprimant les détails d'implémentation. Cela aide à réduire le nombre de tokens tout en maintenant les informations structurelles importantes.

Avantages principaux :
- Réduit significativement le nombre de tokens
- Préserve les signatures des classes et des fonctions
- Maintient les imports et exports
- Conserve les définitions de types et les interfaces
- Supprime les corps de fonctions et les détails d'implémentation

Pour plus de détails et d'exemples, consultez le [Guide de compression du code](code-compress).

### Intégration Git

La configuration `output.git` fournit des fonctionnalités puissantes liées à Git :

- `sortByChanges` : Lorsque vrai, les fichiers sont triés par nombre de modifications Git (commits qui ont modifié le fichier). Les fichiers avec plus de modifications apparaissent en bas de la sortie. Cela aide à prioriser les fichiers plus activement développés. Par défaut : `true`
- `sortByChangesMaxCommits` : Le nombre maximum de commits à analyser lors du comptage des modifications de fichiers. Par défaut : `100`
- `includeDiffs` : Lorsque vrai, inclut les différences Git dans la sortie (inclut séparément les modifications de l'arborescence de travail et les modifications indexées). Cela permet au lecteur de voir les modifications en attente dans le dépôt. Par défaut : `false`
- `includeLogs` : Lorsque vrai, inclut l'historique des commits Git dans la sortie. Montre les dates des commits, les messages et les chemins de fichiers pour chaque commit. Cela aide l'IA à comprendre les modèles de développement et les relations entre fichiers. Par défaut : `false`
- `includeLogsCount` : Le nombre de commits récents à inclure dans les journaux git. Par défaut : `50`

Exemple de configuration :
```json
{
  "output": {
    "git": {
      "sortByChanges": true,
      "sortByChangesMaxCommits": 100,
      "includeDiffs": true,
      "includeLogs": true,
      "includeLogsCount": 25
    }
  }
}
```

### Vérifications de sécurité

Lorsque `security.enableSecurityCheck` est activé, Repomix utilise [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint) pour détecter les informations sensibles dans votre base de code avant de les inclure dans la sortie. Cela aide à prévenir l'exposition accidentelle de :

- Clés API
- Jetons d'accès
- Clés privées
- Mots de passe
- Autres informations d'identification sensibles

### Suppression des commentaires

Lorsque `output.removeComments` est défini à `true`, les commentaires sont supprimés des types de fichiers pris en charge pour réduire la taille de sortie et se concentrer sur le contenu essentiel du code. Cela peut être particulièrement utile lorsque :

- Vous travaillez avec du code fortement documenté
- Vous essayez de réduire le nombre de tokens
- Vous vous concentrez sur la structure et la logique du code

Pour les langages pris en charge et des exemples détaillés, consultez le [Guide de suppression des commentaires](comment-removal).

# Instructions personnalisées

Repomix vous permet de fournir des instructions personnalisées qui seront incluses dans le fichier de sortie. Cela peut être utile pour ajouter du contexte ou des directives spécifiques pour les systèmes d'IA traitant le dépôt.

## Utilisation

Pour inclure une instruction personnalisée, créez un fichier markdown (par exemple, `repomix-instruction.md`) à la racine de votre dépôt. Ensuite, spécifiez le chemin vers ce fichier dans votre `repomix.config.json`:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "instructionFilePath": "repomix-instruction.md"
  }
}
```

Le contenu de ce fichier sera inclus dans la sortie sous la section "Instruction".

## Exemple

```markdown
# Instructions du dépôt
Ce dépôt contient le code source de l'outil Repomix. Veuillez suivre ces directives lors de l'analyse du code:
1. Concentrez-vous sur les fonctionnalités principales dans le répertoire `src/core`.
2. Portez une attention particulière aux vérifications de sécurité dans `src/core/security`.
3. Ignorez tous les fichiers dans le répertoire `tests`.
```

Cela donnera la section suivante dans la sortie:

```xml
<instruction>
# Instructions du dépôt

# Serveur MCP

Repomix prend en charge le [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), permettant aux assistants IA d'interagir directement avec votre base de code. Lorsqu'il est exécuté en tant que serveur MCP, Repomix fournit des outils permettant aux assistants IA de packager des dépôts locaux ou distants pour analyse sans nécessiter de préparation manuelle des fichiers.

> [!NOTE]  
> Il s'agit d'une fonctionnalité expérimentale que nous améliorerons activement en fonction des retours utilisateurs et de l'usage réel

## Exécuter Repomix comme serveur MCP

Pour exécuter Repomix en tant que serveur MCP, utilisez l'option `--mcp`:
```bash
repomix --mcp
```

Cela démarre Repomix en mode serveur MCP, le rendant disponible pour les assistants IA qui prennent en charge le Model Context Protocol.

## Configuration des serveurs MCP

Pour utiliser Repomix comme serveur MCP avec des assistants IA comme Claude, vous devez configurer les paramètres MCP:

### Pour VS Code

Vous pouvez installer le serveur MCP Repomix dans VS Code en utilisant l'une de ces méthodes:

1. **Utilisation du badge d'installation :**

  [![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-VS_Code?style=flat-square&label=Install%20Server&color=0098FF)](vscode:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22repomix%22%2C%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22repomix%22%2C%22--mcp%22%5D%7D)<br>
  [![Install in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-VS_Code_Insiders?style=flat-square&label=Install%20Server&color=24bfa5)](vscode-insiders:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22repomix%22%2C%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22repomix%22%2C%22--mcp%22%5D%7D)

2. **Utilisation de la ligne de commande :**

  ```bash
  code --add-mcp '{"name":"repomix","command":"npx","args":["-y","repomix","--mcp"]}'
  ```

  Pour VS Code Insiders :
  ```bash
  code-insiders --add-mcp '{"name":"repomix","command":"npx","args":["-y","repomix","--mcp"]}'
  ```

### Pour Cline (extension VS Code)

Modifiez le fichier `cline_mcp_settings.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "repomix": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "repomix",
        "--mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Pour Cursor

Dans Cursor, ajoutez un nouveau serveur MCP depuis `Cursor Settings` > `MCP` > `+ Add new global MCP server` avec une configuration similaire à celle de Cline.

### Pour Claude Desktop

Modifiez le fichier `claude_desktop_config.json` avec une configuration similaire à celle de Cline.

### Pour Claude Code

Pour configurer Repomix comme serveur MCP dans [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview), utilisez la commande suivante:

```bash
claude mcp add repomix -- npx -y repomix --mcp
```

Alternativement, vous pouvez utiliser les **plugins officiels Repomix** pour une expérience plus pratique. Les plugins fournissent des commandes en langage naturel et une configuration plus facile. Consultez la documentation [Plugins Claude Code](/fr/guide/claude-code-plugins) pour plus de détails.

### Utilisation de Docker au lieu de npx

Au lieu d'utiliser npx, vous pouvez utiliser Docker pour exécuter Repomix en tant que serveur MCP:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "repomix-docker": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix",
        "--mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Outils MCP disponibles

En mode serveur MCP, Repomix fournit les outils suivants:

### pack_codebase

Cet outil package un répertoire de code local dans un fichier XML pour l'analyse par IA. Il analyse la structure de la base de code, extrait le contenu de code pertinent et génère un rapport complet incluant les métriques, l'arbre des fichiers et le contenu de code formaté.

**Paramètres:**
- `directory`: (Requis) Chemin absolu vers le répertoire à packager
- `compress`: (Optionnel, par défaut: false) Active la compression Tree-sitter pour extraire les signatures de code essentielles et la structure tout en supprimant les détails d'implémentation. Réduit l'utilisation de tokens d'environ 70% tout en préservant la signification sémantique. Généralement non nécessaire car grep_repomix_output permet la récupération incrémentale de contenu. Utilisez uniquement lorsque vous avez spécifiquement besoin du contenu complet de la base de code pour de gros dépôts.
- `includePatterns`: (Optionnel) Spécifie les fichiers à inclure en utilisant des motifs fast-glob. Plusieurs motifs peuvent être séparés par des virgules (ex: "**/*.{js,ts}", "src/**,docs/**"). Seuls les fichiers correspondants seront traités.
- `ignorePatterns`: (Optionnel) Spécifie les fichiers supplémentaires à exclure en utilisant des motifs fast-glob. Plusieurs motifs peuvent être séparés par des virgules (ex: "test/**,*.spec.js", "node_modules/**,dist/**"). Ces motifs complètent .gitignore et les exclusions intégrées.
- `topFilesLength`: (Optionnel, par défaut: 10) Nombre de plus gros fichiers par taille à afficher dans le résumé des métriques pour l'analyse de la base de code.

**Exemple:**
```json
{
  "directory": "/path/to/your/project",
  "compress": false,
  "includePatterns": "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md",
  "ignorePatterns": "**/*.log,tmp/",
  "topFilesLength": 10
}
```

### pack_remote_repository

Cet outil récupère, clone et package un dépôt GitHub dans un fichier XML pour l'analyse par IA. Il clone automatiquement le dépôt distant, analyse sa structure et génère un rapport complet.

**Paramètres:**
- `remote`: (Requis) URL du dépôt GitHub ou format utilisateur/dépôt (ex: "yamadashy/repomix", "https://github.com/user/repo", ou "https://github.com/user/repo/tree/branch")
- `compress`: (Optionnel, par défaut: false) Active la compression Tree-sitter pour extraire les signatures de code essentielles et la structure tout en supprimant les détails d'implémentation. Réduit l'utilisation de tokens d'environ 70% tout en préservant la signification sémantique. Généralement non nécessaire car grep_repomix_output permet la récupération incrémentale de contenu. Utilisez uniquement lorsque vous avez spécifiquement besoin du contenu complet de la base de code pour de gros dépôts.
- `includePatterns`: (Optionnel) Spécifie les fichiers à inclure en utilisant des motifs fast-glob. Plusieurs motifs peuvent être séparés par des virgules (ex: "**/*.{js,ts}", "src/**,docs/**"). Seuls les fichiers correspondants seront traités.
- `ignorePatterns`: (Optionnel) Spécifie les fichiers supplémentaires à exclure en utilisant des motifs fast-glob. Plusieurs motifs peuvent être séparés par des virgules (ex: "test/**,*.spec.js", "node_modules/**,dist/**"). Ces motifs complètent .gitignore et les exclusions intégrées.
- `topFilesLength`: (Optionnel, par défaut: 10) Nombre de plus gros fichiers par taille à afficher dans le résumé des métriques pour l'analyse de la base de code.

**Exemple:**
```json
{
  "remote": "yamadashy/repomix",
  "compress": false,
  "includePatterns": "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md",
  "ignorePatterns": "**/*.log,tmp/",
  "topFilesLength": 10
}
```

### read_repomix_output

Cet outil lit le contenu d'un fichier de sortie généré par Repomix. Il prend en charge la lecture partielle avec spécification de plage de lignes pour les gros fichiers. Cet outil est conçu pour les environnements où l'accès direct au système de fichiers est limité.

**Paramètres:**
- `outputId`: (Requis) ID du fichier de sortie Repomix à lire
- `startLine`: (Optionnel) Numéro de ligne de début (basé sur 1, inclusif). Si non spécifié, lit depuis le début.
- `endLine`: (Optionnel) Numéro de ligne de fin (basé sur 1, inclusif). Si non spécifié, lit jusqu'à la fin.

**Fonctionnalités:**
- Conçu spécifiquement pour les environnements basés sur le web ou les applications en bac à sable
- Récupère le contenu des sorties générées précédemment en utilisant leur ID
- Fournit un accès sécurisé à la base de code packagée sans nécessiter d'accès au système de fichiers
- Prend en charge la lecture partielle pour les gros fichiers

**Exemple:**
```json
{
  "outputId": "8f7d3b1e2a9c6054",
  "startLine": 100,
  "endLine": 200
}
```

### grep_repomix_output

Cet outil recherche des motifs dans un fichier de sortie Repomix en utilisant une fonctionnalité similaire à grep avec la syntaxe JavaScript RegExp. Il retourne les lignes correspondantes avec des lignes de contexte optionnelles autour des correspondances.

**Paramètres:**
- `outputId`: (Requis) ID du fichier de sortie Repomix à rechercher
- `pattern`: (Requis) Motif de recherche (syntaxe d'expression régulière JavaScript RegExp)
- `contextLines`: (Optionnel, par défaut: 0) Nombre de lignes de contexte à afficher avant et après chaque correspondance. Remplacé par beforeLines/afterLines si spécifié.
- `beforeLines`: (Optionnel) Nombre de lignes de contexte à afficher avant chaque correspondance (comme grep -B). Priorité sur contextLines.
- `afterLines`: (Optionnel) Nombre de lignes de contexte à afficher après chaque correspondance (comme grep -A). Priorité sur contextLines.
- `ignoreCase`: (Optionnel, par défaut: false) Effectue une correspondance insensible à la casse

**Fonctionnalités:**
- Utilise la syntaxe JavaScript RegExp pour une correspondance de motifs puissante
- Prend en charge les lignes de contexte pour une meilleure compréhension des correspondances
- Permet un contrôle séparé des lignes de contexte avant/après
- Options de recherche sensible et insensible à la casse

**Exemple:**
```json
{
  "outputId": "8f7d3b1e2a9c6054",
  "pattern": "function\\s+\\w+\\(",
  "contextLines": 3,
  "ignoreCase": false
}
```

### file_system_read_file et file_system_read_directory

Le serveur MCP de Repomix fournit deux outils système de fichiers qui permettent aux assistants IA d'interagir en toute sécurité avec le système de fichiers local:

1. `file_system_read_file`
  - Lit le contenu des fichiers du système de fichiers local en utilisant des chemins absolus
  - Inclut une validation de sécurité intégrée pour détecter et prévenir l'accès aux fichiers contenant des informations sensibles
  - Implémente la validation de sécurité avec [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint)
  - Empêche l'accès aux fichiers contenant des informations sensibles (clés API, mots de passe, secrets)
  - Valide les chemins absolus pour prévenir les attaques par traversée de répertoire
  - Renvoie des messages d'erreur clairs pour les chemins invalides et les problèmes de sécurité

2. `file_system_read_directory`
  - Liste le contenu d'un répertoire en utilisant un chemin absolu
  - Renvoie une liste formatée montrant les fichiers et sous-répertoires avec des indicateurs clairs
  - Affiche les fichiers et répertoires avec des indicateurs clairs (`[FILE]` ou `[DIR]`)
  - Fournit une traversée sécurisée des répertoires avec une gestion appropriée des erreurs
  - Valide les chemins et s'assure qu'ils sont absolus
  - Utile pour explorer la structure du projet et comprendre l'organisation de la base de code

Les deux outils intègrent des mesures de sécurité robustes:
- Validation des chemins absolus pour prévenir les attaques par traversée de répertoire
- Vérifications des permissions pour assurer des droits d'accès appropriés
- Intégration avec Secretlint pour la détection d'informations sensibles
- Messages d'erreur clairs pour un meilleur débogage et une meilleure sensibilisation à la sécurité

**Exemple:**
```typescript
// Lecture d'un fichier
const fileContent = await tools.file_system_read_file({
  path: '/absolute/path/to/file.txt'
});

// Liste du contenu d'un répertoire
const dirContent = await tools.file_system_read_directory({
  path: '/absolute/path/to/directory'
});
```

Ces outils sont particulièrement utiles lorsque les assistants IA doivent:
- Analyser des fichiers spécifiques dans la base de code

# Formats de sortie

Repomix prend en charge quatre formats de sortie:
- XML (par défaut)
- Markdown
- JSON
- Texte brut

## Format XML

```bash
repomix --style xml
```

Le format XML est optimisé pour le traitement par l'IA:

```xml
Ce fichier est une représentation fusionnée de toute la base de code...
<file_summary>
(Métadonnées et instructions pour l'IA)
</file_summary>
<directory_structure>
src/
  index.ts
  utils/
    helper.ts
</directory_structure>
<files>
<file path="src/index.ts">
// Contenu du fichier ici
</file>
</files>

### Pourquoi XML comme format par défaut ?

Repomix utilise XML comme format de sortie par défaut basé sur des recherches et tests approfondis. Cette décision se fonde sur des preuves empiriques et des considérations pratiques pour l'analyse de code assistée par IA.

Notre choix de XML est principalement influencé par les recommandations officielles des principaux fournisseurs d'IA :
- **Anthropic (Claude)** : Recommande explicitement l'utilisation de balises XML pour structurer les prompts, déclarant que "Claude a été exposé à de tels prompts pendant l'entraînement" ([documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/use-xml-tags))
- **Google (Gemini)** : Recommande les formats structurés incluant XML pour les tâches complexes ([documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/structure-prompts))
- **OpenAI (GPT)** : Préconise le prompting structuré dans les scénarios complexes ([annonce](https://x.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1890147300493914437), [cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5_prompting_guide))

## Format Markdown

```bash
repomix --style markdown
```

Le Markdown offre un formatage lisible:

````markdown
Ce fichier est une représentation fusionnée de toute la base de code...
# Résumé du fichier

````

## Format JSON

```bash
repomix --style json
```

Le format JSON fournit une sortie structurée et programmatiquement accessible avec des noms de propriétés en camelCase :

```json
{
  "fileSummary": {
    "generationHeader": "Ce fichier est une représentation fusionnée de toute la base de code, combinée en un seul document par Repomix.",
    "purpose": "Ce fichier contient une représentation compactée du contenu de tout le dépôt...",
    "fileFormat": "Le contenu est organisé comme suit...",
    "usageGuidelines": "- Ce fichier doit être traité comme étant en lecture seule...",
    "notes": "- Certains fichiers peuvent avoir été exclus selon les règles .gitignore..."
  },
  "userProvidedHeader": "Texte d'en-tête personnalisé si spécifié",
  "directoryStructure": "src/
  cli/
    cliOutput.ts
    index.ts
  config/
    configLoader.ts",
  "files": {
    "src/index.js": "// Contenu du fichier ici",
    "src/utils.js": "// Contenu du fichier ici"
  },
  "instruction": "Instructions personnalisées depuis instructionFilePath"
}
```

### Avantages du format JSON

Le format JSON est idéal pour :
- **Traitement programmatique** : Facile à analyser et manipuler avec les bibliothèques JSON dans n'importe quel langage de programmation
- **Intégration API** : Consommation directe par les services web et applications
- **Compatibilité outils IA** : Format structuré optimisé pour l'apprentissage automatique et les systèmes IA
- **Analyse de données** : Extraction simple d'informations spécifiques avec des outils comme `jq`

### Travailler avec la sortie JSON en utilisant `jq`

Le format JSON facilite l'extraction programmatique d'informations spécifiques. Voici des exemples courants :

#### Opérations de fichiers de base
```bash
# Lister tous les chemins de fichiers
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[]'

# Compter le nombre total de fichiers
cat repomix-output.json | jq '.files | keys | length'

# Extraire le contenu d'un fichier spécifique
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files["README.md"]'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files["src/index.js"]'
```

#### Filtrage et analyse de fichiers
```bash
# Trouver des fichiers par extension
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(endswith(".ts"))'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(endswith(".js") or endswith(".ts"))'

# Obtenir des fichiers contenant un texte spécifique
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | select(.value | contains("function")) | .key'

# Créer une liste de fichiers avec nombre de caractères
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | "\(.key): \(.value | length) caractères"'
```

#### Extraction de métadonnées
```bash
# Extraire la structure des répertoires
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.directoryStructure'

# Obtenir les informations du résumé de fichier
cat repomix-output.json | jq '.fileSummary.purpose'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.fileSummary.generationHeader'

# Extraire l'en-tête fourni par l'utilisateur (s'il existe)
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.userProvidedHeader // "Aucun en-tête fourni"'

# Obtenir les instructions personnalisées
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.instruction // "Aucune instruction fournie"'
```

#### Analyse avancée
```bash
# Trouver les plus gros fichiers par longueur de contenu
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | [.key, (.value | length)] | @tsv' | sort -k2 -nr | head -10

# Rechercher des fichiers contenant des motifs spécifiques
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | select(.value | test("import.*react"; "i")) | .key'

# Extraire les chemins de fichiers correspondant à plusieurs extensions
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(test("\.(js|ts|jsx|tsx)$"))'
```

## Format texte brut

```bash
repomix --style plain
```

Structure de sortie:

## File: website/client/src/fr/guide/security.md
`````markdown
# Sécurité

## Fonctionnalité de vérification de sécurité

Repomix utilise [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint) pour détecter les informations sensibles dans vos fichiers:
- Clés d'API
- Jetons d'accès
- Identifiants
- Clés privées
- Variables d'environnement

## Configuration

Les vérifications de sécurité sont activées par défaut.

Désactivation via CLI:
```bash
repomix --no-security-check
```

Ou dans `repomix.config.json`:
```json
{
  "security": {
    "enableSecurityCheck": false
  }
}
```

## Mesures de sécurité

1. **Gestion des fichiers binaires**: Les contenus des fichiers binaires sont exclus de la sortie, mais leurs chemins sont listés dans la structure des répertoires pour une vue d'ensemble complète du dépôt
2. **Compatible avec Git**: Respecte les motifs `.gitignore`
3. **Détection automatisée**: Analyse les problèmes de sécurité courants:
    - Identifiants AWS
    - Chaînes de connexion aux bases de données
    - Jetons d'authentification
    - Clés privées

## Lorsque la vérification de sécurité trouve des problèmes

Exemple de sortie:
```bash
🔍 Vérification de sécurité:
────────────────────────────
2 fichier(s) suspect(s) détecté(s) et exclu(s):
1. config/credentials.json
  - Clé d'accès AWS trouvée
2. .env.local
  - Mot de passe de base de données trouvé
```

## Meilleures pratiques

1. Toujours examiner la sortie avant de la partager
2. Utiliser `.repomixignore` pour les chemins sensibles
3. Garder les vérifications de sécurité activées
4. Supprimer les fichiers sensibles du dépôt

## Signalement des problèmes de sécurité

Vous avez trouvé une vulnérabilité de sécurité? Veuillez:
1. Ne pas ouvrir un ticket public
2. Envoyer un email à: koukun0120@gmail.com
3. Ou utiliser les [Avis de sécurité GitHub](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/security/advisories/new)

`````markdown
# Utilisation de base

## Démarrage rapide

Empaquetez tout votre dépôt:

```bash
repomix
```

## Cas d'utilisation courants

### Empaqueter des répertoires spécifiques

```bash
repomix path/to/directory
```

### Inclure des fichiers spécifiques

Utilisez des [motifs glob](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax):

```bash
repomix --include "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md"
```

### Exclure des fichiers

```bash
repomix --ignore "**/*.log,tmp/"
```

### Dépôts distants

```bash
# En utilisant l'URL GitHub
repomix --remote https://github.com/user/repo
# En utilisant le format abrégé
repomix --remote user/repo
# Branche/tag/commit spécifique
repomix --remote user/repo --remote-branch main
repomix --remote user/repo --remote-branch 935b695
```

### Entrée de liste de fichiers (stdin)

Passez les chemins de fichiers via stdin pour une flexibilité ultime:

```bash
# En utilisant la commande find
find src -name "*.ts" -type f | repomix --stdin

# En utilisant git pour obtenir les fichiers suivis
git ls-files "*.ts" | repomix --stdin

# En utilisant grep pour trouver des fichiers contenant du contenu spécifique
grep -l "TODO" **/*.ts | repomix --stdin

# En utilisant ripgrep pour trouver des fichiers avec du contenu spécifique
rg -l "TODO|FIXME" --type ts | repomix --stdin

# En utilisant ripgrep (rg) pour trouver des fichiers
rg --files --type ts | repomix --stdin

# En utilisant sharkdp/fd pour trouver des fichiers
fd -e ts | repomix --stdin

# En utilisant fzf pour sélectionner à partir de tous les fichiers
fzf -m | repomix --stdin

# Sélection interactive de fichiers avec fzf
find . -name "*.ts" -type f | fzf -m | repomix --stdin

# En utilisant ls avec des motifs glob
ls src/**/*.ts | repomix --stdin

# À partir d'un fichier contenant des chemins de fichiers
cat file-list.txt | repomix --stdin

# Entrée directe avec echo
echo -e "src/index.ts\nsrc/utils.ts" | repomix --stdin
```

L'option `--stdin` vous permet de transmettre une liste de chemins de fichiers à Repomix, offrant une flexibilité ultime dans la sélection des fichiers à empaqueter.

Lorsque vous utilisez `--stdin`, les fichiers spécifiés sont effectivement ajoutés aux motifs d'inclusion. Cela signifie que le comportement normal d'inclusion et d'exclusion s'applique toujours - les fichiers spécifiés via stdin seront toujours exclus s'ils correspondent aux motifs d'exclusion.

> [!NOTE]
> Lors de l'utilisation de `--stdin`, les chemins de fichiers peuvent être relatifs ou absolus, et Repomix gèrera automatiquement la résolution des chemins et la déduplication.

### Compression de code

```bash
repomix --compress

# Vous pouvez également l'utiliser avec des dépôts distants:
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix --compress
```

### Intégration Git

Inclure des informations Git pour fournir un contexte de développement pour l'analyse IA :

```bash
# Inclure les diffs git (modifications non commitées)
repomix --include-diffs

# Inclure les journaux de commits git (derniers 50 commits par défaut)
repomix --include-logs

# Inclure un nombre spécifique de commits
repomix --include-logs --include-logs-count 10

# Inclure à la fois les diffs et les journaux
repomix --include-diffs --include-logs
```

Cela ajoute un contexte précieux sur :
- **Modifications récentes** : Les diffs Git montrent les modifications non commitées
- **Modèles de développement** : Les journaux Git révèlent quels fichiers sont généralement modifiés ensemble
- **Historique des commits** : Les messages de commits récents donnent un aperçu du focus de développement
- **Relations entre fichiers** : Comprendre quels fichiers sont modifiés dans les mêmes commits

### Optimisation du nombre de jetons

Comprendre la distribution des jetons de votre base de code est crucial pour optimiser les interactions IA. Utilisez l'option `--token-count-tree` pour visualiser l'utilisation des jetons dans votre projet entier:

```bash
repomix --token-count-tree
```

Cela affiche une vue hiérarchique de votre base de code avec les comptes de jetons:

```
🔢 Token Count Tree:
────────────────────
└── src/ (70,925 tokens)
    ├── cli/ (12,714 tokens)
    │   ├── actions/ (7,546 tokens)
    │   └── reporters/ (990 tokens)
    └── core/ (41,600 tokens)
        ├── file/ (10,098 tokens)
        └── output/ (5,808 tokens)
```

Vous pouvez également définir un seuil minimum de jetons pour vous concentrer sur les fichiers plus volumineux:

```bash
repomix --token-count-tree 1000  # Afficher uniquement les fichiers/répertoires avec 1000+ jetons
```

Cela vous aide à:
- **Identifier les fichiers lourds en jetons** - qui pourraient dépasser les limites de contexte IA
- **Optimiser la sélection de fichiers** - en utilisant les motifs `--include` et `--ignore`
- **Planifier les stratégies de compression** - en ciblant les plus gros contributeurs
- **Équilibrer contenu vs contexte** - lors de la préparation du code pour l'analyse IA

## Formats de sortie

```bash
repomix --style xml
```

### Markdown

```bash
repomix --style markdown
```

### JSON

## प्रभावी प्रॉम्प्ट लिखना

### स्पष्ट निर्देश दें

AI मॉडल को स्पष्ट और विशिष्ट निर्देश दें:

```
इस रिपॉजिटरी का विश्लेषण करें और निम्नलिखित पर ध्यान केंद्रित करें:
1. कोड संरचना और आर्किटेक्चर
2. संभावित प्रदर्शन बॉटलनेक
3. सुरक्षा कमजोरियां
```

### संदर्भ प्रदान करें

AI को आपके प्रोजेक्ट के बारे में अधिक जानकारी दें:

```
यह एक Node.js बैकएंड API है जो MongoDB का उपयोग करता है और AWS पर होस्ट किया गया है। 
मुझे प्रमाणीकरण प्रणाली में सुधार करने की आवश्यकता है।
```

### विशिष्ट प्रश्न पूछें

सामान्य प्रश्नों के बजाय विशिष्ट प्रश्न पूछें:

```
इस कोड में JWT प्रमाणीकरण कैसे लागू किया गया है और क्या कोई सुरक्षा समस्याएं हैं?
```

## AI के साथ कोड समीक्षा

### समीक्षा के लिए फोकस क्षेत्र निर्दिष्ट करें

AI को बताएं कि आप किन पहलुओं पर ध्यान केंद्रित करना चाहते हैं:

```
कृपया इस कोड की समीक्षा करें, विशेष रूप से:
- प्रदर्शन अनुकूलन
- त्रुटि हैंडलिंग
- कोड पठनीयता
```

### परिवर्तनों का संदर्भ प्रदान करें

बड़े परिवर्तनों के लिए, संदर्भ प्रदान करें:

```
मैंने अभी-अभी हमारी डेटाबेस एक्सेस लेयर को पुनर्लिखित किया है। 
पुराना कोड सिंगल कनेक्शन का उपयोग करता था, नया कोड कनेक्शन पूलिंग का उपयोग करता है।
```

### प्रतिक्रिया पर कार्रवाई करें

AI की प्रतिक्रिया पर कार्रवाई करें और फिर से समीक्षा के लिए अपडेट किए गए कोड को भेजें:

```
मैंने आपके सुझावों के आधार पर परिवर्तन किए हैं। 
कृपया अपडेट किए गए कोड की समीक्षा करें और देखें कि क्या अभी भी कोई समस्याएं हैं।
```

## कोड जनरेशन और रिफैक्टरिंग

### स्पष्ट आवश्यकताएं प्रदान करें

कोड जनरेशन के लिए स्पष्ट आवश्यकताएं प्रदान करें:

```
कृपया एक REST API एंडपॉइंट बनाएं जो:
1. POST अनुरोधों को स्वीकार करता है
2. JSON बॉडी से उपयोगकर्ता डेटा को पार्स करता है
3. MongoDB में डेटा सहेजता है
4. उचित त्रुटि हैंडलिंग प्रदान करता है
```

### मौजूदा कोड शैली का पालन करें

AI को मौजूदा कोड शैली का पालन करने के लिए कहें:

```
कृपया इस फंक्शन को रिफैक्टर करें, लेकिन प्रोजेक्ट की मौजूदा कोडिंग शैली और पैटर्न का पालन करें।
```

### छोटे टुकड़ों में काम करें

बड़े परिवर्तनों को छोटे, प्रबंधनीय टुकड़ों में विभाजित करें:

```
मुझे इस पूरे मॉड्यूल को रिफैक्टर करने की आवश्यकता है। 
आइए पहले डेटा एक्सेस लेयर पर ध्यान केंद्रित करें, फिर बिजनेस लॉजिक पर जाएंगे।
```

## डिबगिंग और समस्या निवारण

### संपूर्ण त्रुटि संदेश प्रदान करें

त्रुटि संदेश और स्टैक ट्रेस का पूरा विवरण प्रदान करें:

```
मैं निम्नलिखित त्रुटि का सामना कर रहा हूं:
TypeError: Cannot read property 'id' of undefined
    at UserService.findById (/src/services/user.service.ts:45:23)
    at async UserController.getUser (/src/controllers/user.controller.ts:32:18)
```

### संदर्भ और पुनरुत्पादन चरण प्रदान करें

समस्या का संदर्भ और पुनरुत्पादन चरण प्रदान करें:

```
यह त्रुटि केवल तब होती है जब उपयोगकर्ता एक विशिष्ट API एंडपॉइंट पर GET अनुरोध भेजता है और क्वेरी पैरामीटर में 'filter' पैरामीटर शामिल होता है।
```

### एक समय में एक परिवर्तन करें

डिबगिंग के दौरान एक समय में एक परिवर्तन करें:

```
मैंने पहले सुझाव को लागू किया है और त्रुटि अभी भी हो रही है। 
क्या हम अगले समाधान पर आगे बढ़ सकते हैं?
```

## प्रोजेक्ट दस्तावेज़ीकरण

### AI से दस्तावेज़ीकरण जनरेट करें

AI का उपयोग दस्तावेज़ीकरण जनरेट करने के लिए करें:

```
कृपया इस कोड के लिए JSDoc टिप्पणियां जनरेट करें, जिसमें पैरामीटर, रिटर्न वैल्यू और उदाहरण शामिल हों।
```

### दस्तावेज़ीकरण अपडेट करें

कोड परिवर्तनों के साथ दस्तावेज़ीकरण अपडेट करें:

```
मैंने इस API में कुछ नए पैरामीटर जोड़े हैं। कृपया README.md फाइल अपडेट करें ताकि इन परिवर्तनों को दर्शाया जा सके।
```

### उपयोगकर्ता गाइड बनाएं

AI का उपयोग उपयोगकर्ता गाइड बनाने के लिए करें:

```
कृपया इस CLI टूल के लिए एक उपयोगकर्ता गाइड बनाएं, जिसमें इंस्टॉलेशन, कॉन्फिगरेशन और सामान्य उपयोग के उदाहरण शामिल हों।
```

## सामान्य सर्वोत्तम प्रथाएं

### Repomix आउटपुट को नियमित रूप से अपडेट करें

जैसे-जैसे आपका कोडबेस विकसित होता है, Repomix आउटपुट को अपडेट करें:

```bash
# प्रत्येक स्प्रिंट के अंत में या महत्वपूर्ण परिवर्तनों के बाद चलाएं
repomix --output-file latest-codebase.xml
```

### AI प्रतिक्रिया को सत्यापित करें

AI द्वारा जनरेट किए गए कोड को हमेशा सत्यापित करें:

1. **कोड समीक्षा**: AI द्वारा जनरेट किए गए कोड की मैन्युअल समीक्षा करें

# Agent Skills जनरेशन

Repomix [Claude Agent Skills](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) फॉर्मेट में आउटपुट जनरेट कर सकता है, एक स्ट्रक्चर्ड Skills डायरेक्टरी बनाता है जिसे AI असिस्टेंट के लिए पुन: प्रयोज्य कोडबेस रेफरेंस के रूप में उपयोग किया जा सकता है।

यह फीचर विशेष रूप से शक्तिशाली है जब आप रिमोट रिपॉजिटरी से इम्प्लीमेंटेशन रेफर करना चाहते हैं। ओपन सोर्स प्रोजेक्ट्स से Skills जनरेट करके, आप आसानी से Claude से अपने कोड पर काम करते समय विशिष्ट पैटर्न या इम्प्लीमेंटेशन रेफर करने के लिए कह सकते हैं।

एक सिंगल पैक्ड फाइल जनरेट करने के बजाय, Skills जनरेशन AI समझ और grep-फ्रेंडली सर्चिंग के लिए ऑप्टिमाइज़ किए गए मल्टीपल रेफरेंस फाइलों के साथ एक स्ट्रक्चर्ड डायरेक्टरी बनाता है।

> [!NOTE]
> यह एक प्रयोगात्मक फीचर है। आउटपुट फॉर्मेट और ऑप्शन भविष्य के रिलीज में यूजर फीडबैक के आधार पर बदल सकते हैं।

## बेसिक उपयोग

अपनी लोकल डायरेक्टरी से Skills जनरेट करें:

```bash
# करंट डायरेक्टरी से Skills जनरेट करें
repomix --skill-generate

# कस्टम Skills नाम के साथ जनरेट करें
repomix --skill-generate my-project-reference

# विशिष्ट डायरेक्टरी से जनरेट करें
repomix path/to/directory --skill-generate

# रिमोट रिपॉजिटरी से जनरेट करें
repomix --remote https://github.com/user/repo --skill-generate
```

## Skills लोकेशन सिलेक्शन

जब आप कमांड चलाते हैं, Repomix आपको Skills को कहाँ सेव करना है चुनने के लिए कहता है:

1. **Personal Skills** (`~/.claude/skills/`) - आपकी मशीन पर सभी प्रोजेक्ट्स में उपलब्ध
2. **Project Skills** (`.claude/skills/`) - git के माध्यम से आपकी टीम के साथ शेयर

अगर Skills डायरेक्टरी पहले से मौजूद है, आपसे ओवरराइट करने की पुष्टि मांगी जाएगी।

> [!TIP]
> Project Skills जनरेट करते समय, बड़ी फाइलों को कमिट करने से बचने के लिए उन्हें `.gitignore` में जोड़ने पर विचार करें:
> ```gitignore
> .claude/skills/repomix-reference-*/
> ```

## जनरेटेड स्ट्रक्चर

Skills निम्नलिखित स्ट्रक्चर के साथ जनरेट होते हैं:

```text
.claude/skills/<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md                    # मेन Skills मेटाडेटा और डॉक्यूमेंटेशन
└── references/

## ऑटो-जनरेटेड Skills नाम

अगर कोई नाम नहीं दिया जाता, Repomix इस पैटर्न का उपयोग करके ऑटो-जनरेट करता है:

```bash
repomix src/ --skill-generate                # → repomix-reference-src
repomix --remote user/repo --skill-generate  # → repomix-reference-repo
repomix --skill-generate CustomName          # → custom-name (kebab-case में नॉर्मलाइज़)
```

Skills नाम:
- kebab-case (लोअरकेस, हाइफन-सेपरेटेड) में कन्वर्ट
- अधिकतम 64 कैरेक्टर तक सीमित
- पाथ ट्रैवर्सल से प्रोटेक्टेड

## Repomix ऑप्शंस के साथ इंटीग्रेशन

Skills जनरेशन सभी स्टैंडर्ड Repomix ऑप्शंस का सम्मान करता है:

```bash
# फाइल फिल्टरिंग के साथ Skills जनरेट करें
repomix --skill-generate --include "src/**/*.ts" --ignore "**/*.test.ts"

# कम्प्रेशन के साथ Skills जनरेट करें
repomix --skill-generate --compress

# रिमोट रिपॉजिटरी से Skills जनरेट करें
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix --skill-generate

# स्पेसिफिक आउटपुट फॉर्मेट ऑप्शंस के साथ Skills जनरेट करें
repomix --skill-generate --remove-comments --remove-empty-lines
```

### डॉक्यूमेंटेशन-ओनली Skills

`--include` का उपयोग करके, आप GitHub रिपॉजिटरी से केवल डॉक्यूमेंटेशन वाले Skills जनरेट कर सकते हैं। यह तब उपयोगी है जब आप चाहते हैं कि Claude आपके कोड पर काम करते समय स्पेसिफिक लाइब्रेरी या फ्रेमवर्क डॉक्यूमेंटेशन रेफर करे:

```bash
# Claude Code Action डॉक्यूमेंटेशन
repomix --remote https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action --include docs --skill-generate

# Vite डॉक्यूमेंटेशन
repomix --remote https://github.com/vitejs/vite --include docs --skill-generate

# React डॉक्यूमेंटेशन
repomix --remote https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev --include src/content --skill-generate
```

## सीमाएं

`--skill-generate` ऑप्शन इनके साथ उपयोग नहीं किया जा सकता:
- `--stdout` - Skills आउटपुट को फाइलसिस्टम में लिखना आवश्यक है
- `--copy` - Skills आउटपुट एक डायरेक्टरी है, क्लिपबोर्ड में कॉपी नहीं किया जा सकता

## जनरेटेड Skills का उपयोग

जनरेट होने के बाद, आप Claude के साथ Skills का उपयोग कर सकते हैं:

1. **Claude Code**: अगर `~/.claude/skills/` या `.claude/skills/` में सेव किया गया है तो Skills ऑटोमैटिकली उपलब्ध हैं
2. **Claude Web**: कोडबेस एनालिसिस के लिए Skills डायरेक्टरी को Claude पर अपलोड करें
3. **टीम शेयरिंग**: टीम-वाइड एक्सेस के लिए `.claude/skills/` को अपने रिपॉजिटरी में कमिट करें

## उदाहरण वर्कफ्लो

### पर्सनल रेफरेंस लाइब्रेरी बनाना

```bash
# एक इंटरेस्टिंग ओपन सोर्स प्रोजेक्ट क्लोन और एनालाइज़ करें
repomix --remote facebook/react --skill-generate react-reference

# Skills ~/.claude/skills/react-reference/ में सेव होते हैं
# अब आप किसी भी Claude कन्वर्सेशन में React का कोडबेस रेफर कर सकते हैं
```

### टीम प्रोजेक्ट डॉक्यूमेंटेशन

```bash
# अपनी प्रोजेक्ट डायरेक्टरी में
cd my-project

# अपनी टीम के लिए Skills जनरेट करें
repomix --skill-generate

# प्रॉम्प्ट होने पर "Project Skills" चुनें
# Skills .claude/skills/repomix-reference-my-project/ में सेव होते हैं

# कमिट करें और अपनी टीम के साथ शेयर करें
git add .claude/skills/
git commit -m "Add codebase reference Skills"
```

# कोड कम्प्रेशन

Repomix का कोड कम्प्रेशन फीचर आपके कोडबेस को संक्षिप्त करने में मदद करता है, जिससे AI मॉडल के लिए टोकन उपयोग कम हो जाता है और बड़े कोडबेस को संभालना आसान हो जाता है।

## कोड कम्प्रेशन क्या है?

कोड कम्प्रेशन एक प्रक्रिया है जिसमें कोड के महत्वपूर्ण हिस्सों को बनाए रखते हुए कार्यान्वयन विवरण हटा दिए जाते हैं। यह फंक्शन और क्लास सिग्नेचर, इंटरफेस परिभाषाओं और महत्वपूर्ण लॉजिक पर ध्यान केंद्रित करता है।

## कोड कम्प्रेशन का उपयोग कैसे करें

कोड कम्प्रेशन सक्षम करने के लिए, `--compress` फ्लैग का उपयोग करें:

```bash
repomix --compress
```

## कॉन्फिगरेशन फाइल में कोड कम्प्रेशन

आप अपने `repomix.config.json` में भी कोड कम्प्रेशन को कॉन्फिगर कर सकते हैं:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "compress": true
  }
}
```

## कोड कम्प्रेशन कैसे काम करता है

कोड कम्प्रेशन निम्नलिखित तरीके से काम करता है:

1. **फंक्शन सिग्नेचर बनाए रखना**: फंक्शन के नाम, पैरामीटर और रिटर्न टाइप बनाए रखे जाते हैं
2. **कार्यान्वयन विवरण हटाना**: फंक्शन बॉडी को संक्षिप्त किया जाता है
3. **क्लास संरचना बनाए रखना**: क्लास परिभाषाएं, प्रॉपर्टी और मेथड सिग्नेचर बनाए रखे जाते हैं
4. **इंटरफेस और टाइप परिभाषाएं बनाए रखना**: टाइप सिस्टम जानकारी बनाए रखी जाती है

## उदाहरण

### कम्प्रेशन से पहले

```typescript
/**
 * उपयोगकर्ता प्रमाणीकरण सेवा
 */
class AuthService {
  private userRepository: UserRepository;
  private tokenService: TokenService;
  
  constructor(userRepo: UserRepository, tokenSvc: TokenService) {
    this.userRepository = userRepo;
    this.tokenService = tokenSvc;
  }
  
  /**
   * उपयोगकर्ता को प्रमाणित करता है और एक्सेस टोकन वापस करता है
   */
  async authenticate(username: string, password: string): Promise<string> {
    const user = await this.userRepository.findByUsername(username);
    
    if (!user) {
      throw new Error('उपयोगकर्ता नहीं मिला');
    }
    
    const isValid = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.passwordHash);
    
    if (!isValid) {
      throw new Error('अमान्य क्रेडेंशियल');
    }
    
    const token = this.tokenService.generateToken({
      userId: user.id,
      role: user.role,
      permissions: user.permissions
    });
    
    await this.userRepository.updateLastLogin(user.id);
    
    return token;
  }
  
  // अन्य मेथड्स...
}
```

### कम्प्रेशन के बाद

```typescript
/**
 * उपयोगकर्ता प्रमाणीकरण सेवा
 */
class AuthService {
  private userRepository: UserRepository;
  private tokenService: TokenService;
  
  constructor(userRepo: UserRepository, tokenSvc: TokenService) {
    // कार्यान्वयन संक्षिप्त किया गया
  }
  
  /**
   * उपयोगकर्ता को प्रमाणित करता है और एक्सेस टोकन वापस करता है
   */
  async authenticate(username: string, password: string): Promise<string> {
    // कार्यान्वयन संक्षिप्त किया गया
  }
  
  // अन्य मेथड्स...
}
```

## कोड कम्प्रेशन के लाभ

1. **टोकन बचत**: AI मॉडल के लिए टोकन उपयोग कम करें
2. **बड़े कोडबेस**: बड़े कोडबेस को AI मॉडल की कॉन्टेक्स्ट विंडो में फिट करें
3. **संरचनात्मक समझ**: कोड की संरचना पर ध्यान केंद्रित करें, कार्यान्वयन विवरण पर नहीं
4. **संवेदनशील जानकारी**: कार्यान्वयन विवरण में छिपी संवेदनशील जानकारी को हटाएं

## सावधानियां

कोड कम्प्रेशन का उपयोग करते समय कुछ बातों का ध्यान रखें:

1. **कार्यान्वयन विवरण**: कम्प्रेशन कार्यान्वयन विवरण हटा देता है, जो कभी-कभी महत्वपूर्ण हो सकते हैं
2. **बग खोजना**: कम्प्रेस्ड कोड में बग खोजना कठिन हो सकता है
3. **AI समझ**: कुछ मामलों में, AI को कार्यान्वयन विवरण की आवश्यकता हो सकती है

Repomix आपको आउटपुट से कोड टिप्पणियां हटाने की अनुमति देता है। यह सुविधा टोकन उपयोग को कम करने और AI मॉडल के लिए आउटपुट को अधिक संक्षिप्त बनाने में मदद कर सकती है।

## टिप्पणियां हटाने का उपयोग

टिप्पणियां हटाने के लिए, `--remove-comments` विकल्प का उपयोग करें:

```bash
repomix --remove-comments
```

आप इसे अन्य विकल्पों के साथ संयोजित कर सकते हैं:

```bash
repomix --remove-comments --style markdown --output-file output.md
```

## कॉन्फिगरेशन फाइल में टिप्पणियां हटाना

आप अपने `repomix.config.json` में टिप्पणियां हटाने को कॉन्फिगर कर सकते हैं:

```json
{
  "processing": {
    "removeComments": true
  }
}
```

## समर्थित टिप्पणी प्रकार

Repomix निम्नलिखित प्रकार की टिप्पणियों को हटा सकता है:

### सिंगल-लाइन टिप्पणियां

```javascript
// यह एक सिंगल-लाइन टिप्पणी है
const x = 5; // लाइन के अंत में टिप्पणी
```

### मल्टी-लाइन टिप्पणियां

```javascript
/*
 * यह एक मल्टी-लाइन टिप्पणी है
 * जो कई लाइनों पर फैली हुई है
 */
const y = 10;
```

### डॉक्यूमेंटेशन टिप्पणियां

```javascript
/**
 * एक फंक्शन जो दो संख्याओं को जोड़ता है
 * @param {number} a - पहली संख्या
 * @param {number} b - दूसरी संख्या
 * @returns {number} - दोनों संख्याओं का योग
 */
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

### HTML/XML टिप्पणियां

```html
<!-- यह एक HTML टिप्पणी है -->
<div>कंटेंट</div>
```

### पायथन टिप्पणियां

```python
# यह एक पायथन टिप्पणी है
x = 5  # लाइन के अंत में टिप्पणी

"""
यह एक मल्टी-लाइन
पायथन डॉकस्ट्रिंग है
"""
```

## टिप्पणियां हटाने के लाभ

टिप्पणियां हटाने के कई लाभ हैं:

1. **टोकन उपयोग कम करना**: टिप्पणियां हटाकर, आप AI मॉडल के लिए आवश्यक टोकन की संख्या कम कर सकते हैं
2. **शोर कम करना**: टिप्पणियां हटाकर, आप AI मॉडल के लिए आउटपुट को अधिक संक्षिप्त और केंद्रित बना सकते हैं
3. **संवेदनशील जानकारी हटाना**: टिप्पणियां अक्सर संवेदनशील जानकारी या व्यक्तिगत नोट्स शामिल कर सकती हैं

## टिप्पणियां हटाने के नुकसान

टिप्पणियां हटाने के कुछ नुकसान भी हैं:

1. **संदर्भ का नुकसान**: टिप्पणियां अक्सर कोड के बारे में महत्वपूर्ण संदर्भ या स्पष्टीकरण प्रदान करती हैं
2. **डॉक्यूमेंटेशन का नुकसान**: डॉक्यूमेंटेशन टिप्पणियां फंक्शन, पैरामीटर और रिटर्न वैल्यू के बारे में महत्वपूर्ण जानकारी प्रदान करती हैं
3. **कोड समझने में कठिनाई**: टिप्पणियों के बिना, AI मॉडल को कोड का उद्देश्य समझने में कठिनाई हो सकती है

## कब टिप्पणियां हटाएं

निम्नलिखित परिस्थितियों में टिप्पणियां हटाना उपयोगी हो सकता है:

1. **टोकन सीमाओं से निपटना**: जब आप AI मॉडल की टोकन सीमाओं से निपट रहे हों
2. **केवल कोड पर ध्यान केंद्रित करना**: जब आप चाहते हैं कि AI मॉडल केवल कोड पर ध्यान केंद्रित करे
3. **संवेदनशील जानकारी हटाना**: जब टिप्पणियों में संवेदनशील जानकारी शामिल हो

## कब टिप्पणियां न हटाएं

निम्नलिखित परिस्थितियों में टिप्पणियां बनाए रखना बेहतर हो सकता है:

1. **जटिल कोड**: जब कोड जटिल हो और टिप्पणियां महत्वपूर्ण स्पष्टीकरण प्रदान करती हों
2. **API डॉक्यूमेंटेशन**: जब टिप्पणियां API डॉक्यूमेंटेशन के लिए महत्वपूर्ण हों
3. **कोड समझना**: जब आप चाहते हैं कि AI मॉडल कोड के उद्देश्य और कार्यप्रणाली को समझे

## उदाहरण

### टिप्पणियों के साथ कोड

```javascript
/**
 * उपयोगकर्ता को प्रमाणित करता है
 * @param {string} username - उपयोगकर्ता का नाम
 * @param {string} password - उपयोगकर्ता का पासवर्ड
 * @returns {boolean} - प्रमाणीकरण सफल था या नहीं
 */
function authenticateUser(username, password) {
  // डेटाबेस से उपयोगकर्ता प्राप्त करें
  const user = getUserFromDatabase(username);
  
  // यदि उपयोगकर्ता नहीं मिला, तो false लौटाएं
  if (!user) {
    return false;
  }
  
  // पासवर्ड की जांच करें
  return checkPassword(user, password);
}
```

### टिप्पणियों के बिना कोड

```javascript
function authenticateUser(username, password) {
  const user = getUserFromDatabase(username);
  
  if (!user) {
    return false;
  }
  
  return checkPassword(user, password);
}
```

# कॉन्फिगरेशन

Repomix को कॉन्फिगरेशन फ़ाइल या कमांड-लाइन विकल्पों का उपयोग करके कॉन्फिगर किया जा सकता है। कॉन्फिगरेशन फ़ाइल आपको अपने कोडबेस के प्रसंस्करण और आउटपुट के विभिन्न पहलुओं को अनुकूलित करने की अनुमति देती है।

## कॉन्फिगरेशन फ़ाइल प्रारूप

Repomix लचीलेपन और उपयोग में आसानी के लिए कई कॉन्फिगरेशन फ़ाइल प्रारूपों का समर्थन करता है।

Repomix स्वचालित रूप से निम्नलिखित प्राथमिकता क्रम में कॉन्फिगरेशन फ़ाइलों को खोजेगा:

1. **TypeScript** (`repomix.config.ts`, `repomix.config.mts`, `repomix.config.cts`)
2. **JavaScript/ES Module** (`repomix.config.js`, `repomix.config.mjs`, `repomix.config.cjs`)
3. **JSON** (`repomix.config.json5`, `repomix.config.jsonc`, `repomix.config.json`)

### JSON कॉन्फिगरेशन

अपनी प्रोजेक्ट डायरेक्टरी में एक कॉन्फिगरेशन फ़ाइल बनाएं:
```bash
repomix --init
```

यह डिफ़ॉल्ट सेटिंग्स के साथ एक `repomix.config.json` फ़ाइल बनाएगा। आप एक ग्लोबल कॉन्फिगरेशन फ़ाइल भी बना सकते हैं जो स्थानीय कॉन्फिगरेशन नहीं मिलने पर फ़ॉलबैक के रूप में उपयोग होगी:

```bash
repomix --init --global
```

### TypeScript कॉन्फिगरेशन

TypeScript कॉन्फिगरेशन फ़ाइलें पूर्ण टाइप चेकिंग और IDE समर्थन के साथ सर्वोत्तम developer अनुभव प्रदान करती हैं।

**इंस्टॉलेशन:**

TypeScript या JavaScript कॉन्फिगरेशन को `defineConfig` के साथ उपयोग करने के लिए, आपको Repomix को dev dependency के रूप में इंस्टॉल करना होगा:

```bash
npm install -D repomix
```

**उदाहरण:**

```typescript
// repomix.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'repomix';

export default defineConfig({
  output: {
    filePath: 'output.xml',
    style: 'xml',
    removeComments: true,
  },
  ignore: {
    customPatterns: ['**/node_modules/**', '**/dist/**'],
  },
});
```

**लाभ:**
- ✅ आपके IDE में पूर्ण TypeScript टाइप चेकिंग
- ✅ उत्कृष्ट IDE autocomplete और IntelliSense
- ✅ गतिशील मान का उपयोग करें (timestamps, environment variables, आदि)

**गतिशील मान उदाहरण:**

```typescript
// repomix.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'repomix';

// Timestamp-आधारित फ़ाइल नाम generate करें
const timestamp = new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 19).replace(/[:.]/g, '-');

export default defineConfig({
  output: {
    filePath: `output-${timestamp}.xml`,
    style: 'xml',
  },
});
```

### JavaScript कॉन्फिगरेशन

JavaScript कॉन्फिगरेशन फ़ाइलें TypeScript की तरह ही काम करती हैं, `defineConfig` और गतिशील मानों का समर्थन करती हैं।

## कॉन्फिगरेशन विकल्प

कॉन्फिगरेशन फ़ाइल [JSON5](https://json5.org/) सिंटैक्स का समर्थन करती है, जो निम्नलिखित की अनुमति देता है:
- टिप्पणियां (एकल-लाइन और मल्टी-लाइन दोनों)
- ऑब्जेक्ट्स और एरे में trailing commas
- बिना quotes के प्रॉपर्टी नाम
- अधिक लचीला स्ट्रिंग सिंटैक्स

## स्कीमा सत्यापन

आप `$schema` प्रॉपर्टी जोड़कर अपनी कॉन्फिगरेशन फ़ाइल के लिए स्कीमा सत्यापन सक्षम कर सकते हैं:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://repomix.com/schemas/latest/schema.json",
  "output": {
    "filePath": "repomix-output.md",
    "style": "markdown"
  }
}
```

यह JSON स्कीमा समर्थित एडिटर्स में auto-completion और validation प्रदान करता है।

## उदाहरण कॉन्फिगरेशन फ़ाइल

यहां एक पूर्ण कॉन्फिगरेशन फ़ाइल (`repomix.config.json`) का उदाहरण है:

```json5

## कॉन्फिगरेशन फ़ाइल स्थान

Repomix निम्नलिखित क्रम में कॉन्फिगरेशन फ़ाइलों की तलाश करता है:
1. वर्तमान डायरेक्टरी में स्थानीय कॉन्फिगरेशन फ़ाइल (प्राथमिकता क्रम: TS > JS > JSON)
   - TypeScript: `repomix.config.ts`, `repomix.config.mts`, `repomix.config.cts`
   - JavaScript: `repomix.config.js`, `repomix.config.mjs`, `repomix.config.cjs`
   - JSON: `repomix.config.json5`, `repomix.config.jsonc`, `repomix.config.json`
2. ग्लोबल कॉन्फिगरेशन फ़ाइल (प्राथमिकता क्रम: TS > JS > JSON)
   - Windows:
     - TypeScript: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.ts`, `.mts`, `.cts`
     - JavaScript: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`
     - JSON: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.json5`, `.jsonc`, `.json`
   - macOS/Linux:
     - TypeScript: `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.ts`, `.mts`, `.cts`
     - JavaScript: `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`
     - JSON: `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.json5`, `.jsonc`, `.json`

कमांड-लाइन विकल्प कॉन्फिगरेशन फ़ाइल सेटिंग्स से प्राथमिकता रखते हैं।

## Ignore पैटर्न

Repomix कई तरीके प्रदान करता है जिससे आप निर्दिष्ट कर सकते हैं कि कौन सी फ़ाइलों को ignore करना है:

- **.gitignore**: डिफ़ॉल्ट रूप से, प्रोजेक्ट की `.gitignore` फ़ाइल और `.git/info/exclude` में सूचीबद्ध पैटर्न का उपयोग किया जाता है। इस व्यवहार को `ignore.useGitignore` सेटिंग या `--no-gitignore` CLI विकल्प के साथ नियंत्रित किया जा सकता है।
- **.ignore**: आप अपने प्रोजेक्ट रूट में `.ignore` फ़ाइल का उपयोग कर सकते हैं, जो `.gitignore` के समान प्रारूप का पालन करती है। यह फ़ाइल ripgrep और the silver searcher जैसे उपकरणों द्वारा उपयोग की जाती है, जिससे कई ignore फ़ाइलों को बनाए रखने की आवश्यकता कम हो जाती है। इस व्यवहार को `ignore.useDotIgnore` सेटिंग या `--no-dot-ignore` CLI विकल्प के साथ नियंत्रित किया जा सकता है।
- **डिफ़ॉल्ट पैटर्न**: Repomix में आमतौर पर बाहर की गई फ़ाइलों और डायरेक्टरीज़ की एक डिफ़ॉल्ट सूची शामिल है (जैसे node_modules, .git, बाइनरी फ़ाइलें)। इस सुविधा को `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` सेटिंग या `--no-default-patterns` CLI विकल्प के साथ नियंत्रित किया जा सकता है। अधिक विवरण के लिए कृपया [defaultIgnore.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/src/config/defaultIgnore.ts) देखें।
- **.repomixignore**: आप Repomix-विशिष्ट ignore पैटर्न को परिभाषित करने के लिए अपने प्रोजेक्ट रूट में `.repomixignore` फ़ाइल बना सकते हैं। यह फ़ाइल `.gitignore` के समान प्रारूप का पालन करती है।
- **कस्टम पैटर्न**: अतिरिक्त ignore पैटर्न को कॉन्फिगरेशन फ़ाइल में `ignore.customPatterns` विकल्प का उपयोग करके निर्दिष्ट किया जा सकता है। आप इस सेटिंग को `-i, --ignore` कमांड लाइन विकल्प के साथ ओवरराइट कर सकते हैं।

**प्राथमिकता क्रम** (उच्च से निम्न):

1. कस्टम पैटर्न (`ignore.customPatterns`)
2. Ignore फ़ाइलें (`.repomixignore`, `.ignore`, `.gitignore`, और `.git/info/exclude`):
   - जब नेस्टेड डायरेक्टरीज़ में हों, तो गहरी डायरेक्टरीज़ में फ़ाइलें अधिक प्राथमिकता रखती हैं
   - जब समान डायरेक्टरी में हों, तो ये फ़ाइलें बिना किसी विशेष क्रम के मर्ज की जाती हैं
3. डिफ़ॉल्ट पैटर्न (यदि `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` true है और `--no-default-patterns` उपयोग नहीं किया गया है)

`.repomixignore` का उदाहरण:
```text
# कैश डायरेक्टरीज़
.cache/
tmp/

# बिल्ड आउटपुट
dist/
build/

# लॉग्स
*.log
```

## डिफ़ॉल्ट Ignore पैटर्न

जब `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` true है, तो Repomix स्वचालित रूप से सामान्य पैटर्न को ignore करता है:
```text
node_modules/**
.git/**
coverage/**
dist/**
```

पूरी सूची के लिए [defaultIgnore.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/src/config/defaultIgnore.ts) देखें

## उन्नत सुविधाएं

### कोड कम्प्रेशन

कोड कम्प्रेशन सुविधा, `output.compress: true` के साथ सक्षम, [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) का उपयोग करके आवश्यक कोड संरचनाओं को बुद्धिमानी से निकालती है जबकि implementation details को हटाती है। यह महत्वपूर्ण संरचनात्मक जानकारी बनाए रखते हुए टोकन संख्या कम करने में मदद करता है।

मुख्य लाभ:
- टोकन संख्या में महत्वपूर्ण कमी
- क्लास और फ़ंक्शन signatures को संरक्षित करता है
- imports और exports को बनाए रखता है
- type definitions और interfaces को संरक्षित करता है
- फ़ंक्शन bodies और implementation details को हटाता है

अधिक विवरण और उदाहरणों के लिए, [कोड कम्प्रेशन गाइड](code-compress) देखें।

### Git एकीकरण

`output.git` कॉन्फिगरेशन शक्तिशाली Git-aware सुविधाएं प्रदान करता है:

- `sortByChanges`: जब true है, तो फ़ाइलें Git परिवर्तनों की संख्या (फ़ाइल को modify करने वाले commits) के अनुसार सॉर्ट होती हैं। अधिक परिवर्तन वाली फ़ाइलें आउटपुट के नीचे दिखाई देती हैं। यह अधिक सक्रिय रूप से विकसित फ़ाइलों को प्राथमिकता देने में मदद करता है। डिफ़ॉल्ट: `true`
- `sortByChangesMaxCommits`: फ़ाइल परिवर्तनों की गिनती करते समय विश्लेषित करने के लिए अधिकतम commits। डिफ़ॉल्ट: `100`
- `includeDiffs`: जब true है, तो आउटपुट में Git अंतर शामिल करता है (work tree और staged changes को अलग-अलग शामिल करता है)। यह reader को repository में pending changes देखने की अनुमति देता है। डिफ़ॉल्ट: `false`
- `includeLogs`: जब true है, तो आउटपुट में Git कमिट इतिहास शामिल करता है। प्रत्येक कमिट के लिए कमिट तारीखें, संदेश और फ़ाइल पथ दिखाता है। यह AI को विकास पैटर्न और फ़ाइल संबंधों को समझने में मदद करता है। डिफ़ॉल्ट: `false`
- `includeLogsCount`: git logs में शामिल करने के लिए हाल के commits की संख्या। डिफ़ॉल्ट: `50`

कॉन्फिगरेशन उदाहरण:
```json
{
  "output": {
    "git": {
      "sortByChanges": true,
      "sortByChangesMaxCommits": 100,
      "includeDiffs": true,
      "includeLogs": true,
      "includeLogsCount": 25
    }
  }
}
```

### सुरक्षा जांच

जब `security.enableSecurityCheck` सक्षम है, तो Repomix आउटपुट में शामिल करने से पहले आपके कोडबेस में संवेदनशील जानकारी का पता लगाने के लिए [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint) का उपयोग करता है। यह निम्नलिखित की आकस्मिक exposure को रोकने में मदद करता है:

- API keys
- Access tokens
- Private keys
- Passwords
- अन्य संवेदनशील credentials

### टिप्पणी हटाना

जब `output.removeComments` को `true` सेट किया जाता है, तो आउटपुट का आकार कम करने और आवश्यक कोड सामग्री पर ध्यान केंद्रित करने के लिए समर्थित फ़ाइल प्रकारों से टिप्पणियां हटा दी जाती हैं। यह विशेष रूप से तब उपयोगी हो सकता है जब:

- भारी documented कोड के साथ काम कर रहे हों
- टोकन संख्या कम करने की कोशिश कर रहे हों
- कोड structure और logic पर ध्यान केंद्रित कर रहे हों

समर्थित भाषाओं और विस्तृत उदाहरणों के लिए, [टिप्पणी हटाने की गाइड](comment-removal) देखें।

# GitHub Actions

Repomix को GitHub Actions के साथ एकीकृत किया जा सकता है ताकि रिपॉजिटरी को स्वचालित रूप से प्रोसेस किया जा सके और AI-फ्रेंडली आउटपुट जनरेट किया जा सके। यह आपको CI/CD पाइपलाइन के हिस्से के रूप में Repomix का उपयोग करने की अनुमति देता है।

## बुनियादी उपयोग

यहां GitHub Actions में Repomix का उपयोग करने के लिए एक बुनियादी वर्कफ़्लो कॉन्फिगरेशन है:

```yaml
name: Repomix

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  repomix:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      
      - name: Run Repomix
        run: npx repomix --output-file repomix-output.xml
      
      - name: Upload Repomix Output
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: repomix-output
          path: repomix-output.xml
```

यह वर्कफ़्लो मुख्य ब्रांच पर हर पुश या पुल रिक्वेस्ट पर चलता है, रिपॉजिटरी को प्रोसेस करता है और `repomix-output.xml` फाइल जनरेट करता है, फिर इसे आर्टिफैक्ट के रूप में अपलोड करता है।

## उन्नत कॉन्फिगरेशन

अधिक उन्नत कॉन्फिगरेशन के लिए, आप निम्न विकल्पों को जोड़ सकते हैं:

```yaml
name: Repomix Advanced

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 1'  # हर सोमवार को चलाएं
  
jobs:
  repomix:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      
      - name: Run Repomix
        run: |
          npx repomix \
            --style markdown \
            --output-file repomix-output.md \
            --include "src/**/*.ts,docs/**/*.md" \
            --ignore "**/*.test.ts,**/node_modules/**" \
            --remove-comments \
            --compress
      
      - name: Upload Repomix Output
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: repomix-output
          path: repomix-output.md
      
      - name: Create GitHub Release
        if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
        with:
          files: repomix-output.md
          name: Repomix Output ${{ github.sha }}
          tag_name: repomix-${{ github.sha }}
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

इस उन्नत कॉन्फिगरेशन में, हम निम्न कार्य कर रहे हैं:

1. शेड्यूल्ड रन जोड़ना (हर सोमवार)
2. अधिक Repomix विकल्पों का उपयोग करना
3. मुख्य ब्रांच पर पुश होने पर GitHub रिलीज बनाना

## एनवायरनमेंट वेरिएबल्स और सीक्रेट्स

संवेदनशील जानकारी के साथ काम करते समय, आप GitHub सीक्रेट्स का उपयोग कर सकते हैं:

```yaml
- name: Run Repomix with Auth
  run: npx repomix --remote user/private-repo
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## मैट्रिक्स बिल्ड

कई कॉन्फिगरेशन के साथ Repomix चलाने के लिए, आप मैट्रिक्स बिल्ड का उपयोग कर सकते हैं:

```yaml
jobs:
  repomix:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        output-style: [xml, markdown, json, plain]
        node-version: [20, 22]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Setup Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      
      - name: Run Repomix
        run: npx repomix --style ${{ matrix.output-style }} --output-file repomix-output.${{ matrix.output-style }}
      
      - name: Upload Repomix Output
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: repomix-output-${{ matrix.output-style }}-node${{ matrix.node-version }}
          path: repomix-output.${{ matrix.output-style }}
```

## पुल रिक्वेस्ट कमेंट्स

आप Repomix आउटपुट को पुल रिक्वेस्ट पर कमेंट के रूप में भी जोड़ सकते हैं:

```yaml
- name: Run Repomix
  run: npx repomix --style markdown --output-file repomix-output.md

- name: Comment on PR
  if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
  uses: actions/github-script@v6
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    script: |
      const fs = require('fs');
      const output = fs.readFileSync('repomix-output.md', 'utf8');
      const summary = output.split('\n').slice(0, 20).join('\n') + '\n\n[Full output attached as artifact]';
      
      github.rest.issues.createComment({
        issue_number: context.issue.number,
        owner: context.repo.owner,
        repo: context.repo.repo,
        body: summary
      });
```

  code --add-mcp '{"name":"repomix","command":"npx","args":["-y","repomix","--mcp"]}'
  ```

  VS Code Insiders के लिए:
  ```bash
  code-insiders --add-mcp '{"name":"repomix","command":"npx","args":["-y","repomix","--mcp"]}'
  ```

### Cline (VS Code एक्सटेंशन) के लिए

`cline_mcp_settings.json` फ़ाइल को संपादित करें:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "repomix": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "repomix",
        "--mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor के लिए

Cursor में, `Cursor Settings` > `MCP` > `+ Add new global MCP server` से एक नया MCP सर्वर जोड़ें, जो Cline के समान कॉन्फ़िगरेशन के साथ हो।

### Claude Desktop के लिए

`claude_desktop_config.json` फ़ाइल को Cline के समान कॉन्फ़िगरेशन के साथ संपादित करें।

### Claude Code के लिए

[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview) में Repomix को MCP सर्वर के रूप में कॉन्फ़िगर करने के लिए, निम्नलिखित कमांड का उपयोग करें:

```bash
claude mcp add repomix -- npx -y repomix --mcp
```

वैकल्पिक रूप से, आप अधिक सुविधाजनक अनुभव के लिए **आधिकारिक Repomix प्लगइन्स** का उपयोग कर सकते हैं। प्लगइन्स प्राकृतिक भाषा कमांड और आसान सेटअप प्रदान करते हैं। विवरण के लिए [Claude Code प्लगइन्स](/hi/guide/claude-code-plugins) दस्तावेज़ीकरण देखें।

### npx के बजाय Docker का उपयोग करना

npx का उपयोग करने के बजाय, आप Repomix को MCP सर्वर के रूप में चलाने के लिए Docker का उपयोग कर सकते हैं:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "repomix-docker": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix",
        "--mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## उपलब्ध MCP टूल्स

जब MCP सर्वर के रूप में चलाया जाता है, तो Repomix निम्नलिखित टूल्स प्रदान करता है:

### pack_codebase

यह टूल स्थानीय कोड डायरेक्टरी को AI विश्लेषण के लिए XML फ़ाइल में पैकेज करता है। यह कोडबेस संरचना का विश्लेषण करता है, प्रासंगिक कोड सामग्री निकालता है, और मेट्रिक्स, फ़ाइल ट्री, और फॉर्मेटेड कोड सामग्री सहित एक व्यापक रिपोर्ट जेनरेट करता है।

**पैरामीटर:**
- `directory`: (आवश्यक) पैकेज करने के लिए डायरेक्टरी का पूर्ण पथ
- `compress`: (वैकल्पिक, डिफ़ॉल्ट: false) इम्प्लीमेंटेशन विवरण हटाते समय आवश्यक कोड हस्ताक्षर और संरचना निकालने के लिए Tree-sitter संपीड़न सक्षम करता है। सिमेंटिक अर्थ संरक्षित रखते हुए टोकन उपयोग को ~70% कम करता है। आमतौर पर आवश्यक नहीं क्योंकि grep_repomix_output वृद्धिशील सामग्री पुनर्प्राप्ति की अनुमति देता है। केवल तब उपयोग करें जब आपको विशेष रूप से बड़े रिपॉजिटरी के लिए पूरी कोडबेस सामग्री की आवश्यकता हो।
- `includePatterns`: (वैकल्पिक) fast-glob पैटर्न का उपयोग करके शामिल करने के लिए फ़ाइलें निर्दिष्ट करता है। कई पैटर्न को कॉमा से अलग किया जा सकता है (जैसे: "**/*.{js,ts}", "src/**,docs/**")। केवल मैचिंग फ़ाइलें प्रोसेस की जाएंगी।
- `ignorePatterns`: (वैकल्पिक) fast-glob पैटर्न का उपयोग करके बाहर करने के लिए अतिरिक्त फ़ाइलें निर्दिष्ट करता है। कई पैटर्न को कॉमा से अलग किया जा सकता है (जैसे: "test/**,*.spec.js", "node_modules/**,dist/**")। ये पैटर्न .gitignore और बिल्ट-इन एक्सक्लूज़न को पूरक करते हैं।
- `topFilesLength`: (वैकल्पिक, डिफ़ॉल्ट: 10) कोडबेस विश्लेषण के लिए मेट्रिक्स सारांश में दिखाने के लिए आकार के अनुसार सबसे बड़ी फ़ाइलों की संख्या।

**उदाहरण:**
```json
{
  "directory": "/path/to/your/project",
  "compress": false,
  "includePatterns": "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md",
  "ignorePatterns": "**/*.log,tmp/",
  "topFilesLength": 10
}
```

### pack_remote_repository

यह टूल GitHub रिपॉजिटरी को fetch, clone और AI विश्लेषण के लिए XML फ़ाइल में पैकेज करता है। यह स्वचालित रूप से रिमोट रिपॉजिटरी को clone करता है, इसकी संरचना का विश्लेषण करता है, और एक व्यापक रिपोर्ट जेनरेट करता है।

**पैरामीटर:**
- `remote`: (आवश्यक) GitHub रिपॉजिटरी URL या user/repo फॉर्मेट (जैसे: "yamadashy/repomix", "https://github.com/user/repo", या "https://github.com/user/repo/tree/branch")
- `compress`: (वैकल्पिक, डिफ़ॉल्ट: false) इम्प्लीमेंटेशन विवरण हटाते समय आवश्यक कोड हस्ताक्षर और संरचना निकालने के लिए Tree-sitter संपीड़न सक्षम करता है। सिमेंटिक अर्थ संरक्षित रखते हुए टोकन उपयोग को ~70% कम करता है। आमतौर पर आवश्यक नहीं क्योंकि grep_repomix_output वृद्धिशील सामग्री पुनर्प्राप्ति की अनुमति देता है। केवल तब उपयोग करें जब आपको विशेष रूप से बड़े रिपॉजिटरी के लिए पूरी कोडबेस सामग्री की आवश्यकता हो।
- `includePatterns`: (वैकल्पिक) fast-glob पैटर्न का उपयोग करके शामिल करने के लिए फ़ाइलें निर्दिष्ट करता है। कई पैटर्न को कॉमा से अलग किया जा सकता है (जैसे: "**/*.{js,ts}", "src/**,docs/**")। केवल मैचिंग फ़ाइलें प्रोसेस की जाएंगी।
- `ignorePatterns`: (वैकल्पिक) fast-glob पैटर्न का उपयोग करके बाहर करने के लिए अतिरिक्त फ़ाइलें निर्दिष्ट करता है। कई पैटर्न को कॉमा से अलग किया जा सकता है (जैसे: "test/**,*.spec.js", "node_modules/**,dist/**")। ये पैटर्न .gitignore और बिल्ट-इन एक्सक्लूज़न को पूरक करते हैं।
- `topFilesLength`: (वैकल्पिक, डिफ़ॉल्ट: 10) कोडबेस विश्लेषण के लिए मेट्रिक्स सारांश में दिखाने के लिए आकार के अनुसार सबसे बड़ी फ़ाइलों की संख्या।

**उदाहरण:**
```json
{
  "remote": "yamadashy/repomix",
  "compress": false,
  "includePatterns": "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md",
  "ignorePatterns": "**/*.log,tmp/",
  "topFilesLength": 10
}
```

### read_repomix_output

यह टूल Repomix द्वारा जेनरेट की गई आउटपुट फ़ाइल की सामग्री पढ़ता है। बड़ी फ़ाइलों के लिए लाइन रेंज स्पेसिफिकेशन के साथ आंशिक पढ़ने का समर्थन करता है। यह टूल उन वातावरणों के लिए डिज़ाइन किया गया है जहाँ प्रत्यक्ष फ़ाइल सिस्टम पहुंच सीमित है।

**पैरामीटर:**
- `outputId`: (आवश्यक) पढ़ने के लिए Repomix आउटपुट फ़ाइल की ID
- `startLine`: (वैकल्पिक) शुरुआती लाइन नंबर (1-आधारित, समावेशी)। यदि निर्दिष्ट नहीं है, तो शुरुआत से पढ़ता है।
- `endLine`: (वैकल्पिक) अंतिम लाइन नंबर (1-आधारित, समावेशी)। यदि निर्दिष्ट नहीं है, तो अंत तक पढ़ता है।

**विशेषताएं:**
- विशेष रूप से वेब-आधारित वातावरण या सैंडबॉक्स एप्लिकेशन के लिए डिज़ाइन किया गया
- उनकी ID का उपयोग करके पहले से जेनरेट किए गए आउटपुट की सामग्री पुनर्प्राप्त करता है
- फ़ाइल सिस्टम पहुंच की आवश्यकता के बिना पैकेज्ड कोडबेस तक सुरक्षित पहुंच प्रदान करता है
- बड़ी फ़ाइलों के लिए आंशिक पढ़ने का समर्थन करता है

**उदाहरण:**
```json
{
  "outputId": "8f7d3b1e2a9c6054",
  "startLine": 100,
  "endLine": 200
}
```

### grep_repomix_output

यह टूल JavaScript RegExp सिंटैक्स के साथ grep-जैसी कार्यक्षमता का उपयोग करके Repomix आउटपुट फ़ाइल में पैटर्न खोजता है। मैचों के आसपास वैकल्पिक संदर्भ लाइनों के साथ मैचिंग लाइनें वापस करता है।

**पैरामीटर:**
- `outputId`: (आवश्यक) खोजने के लिए Repomix आउटपुट फ़ाइल की ID
- `pattern`: (आवश्यक) खोज पैटर्न (JavaScript RegExp नियमित अभिव्यक्ति सिंटैक्स)
- `contextLines`: (वैकल्पिक, डिफ़ॉल्ट: 0) प्रत्येक मैच से पहले और बाद में दिखाने के लिए संदर्भ लाइनों की संख्या। beforeLines/afterLines निर्दिष्ट होने पर इसे ओवरराइड किया जाता है।
- `beforeLines`: (वैकल्पिक) प्रत्येक मैच से पहले दिखाने के लिए संदर्भ लाइनों की संख्या (grep -B की तरह)। contextLines पर प्राथमिकता लेता है।
- `afterLines`: (वैकल्पिक) प्रत्येक मैच के बाद दिखाने के लिए संदर्भ लाइनों की संख्या (grep -A की तरह)। contextLines पर प्राथमिकता लेता है।
- `ignoreCase`: (वैकल्पिक, डिफ़ॉल्ट: false) केस-इनसेंसिटिव मैचिंग करता है

**विशेषताएं:**
- शक्तिशाली पैटर्न मैचिंग के लिए JavaScript RegExp सिंटैक्स का उपयोग करता है

  "contextLines": 3,
  "ignoreCase": false
}
```

### file_system_read_file और file_system_read_directory

Repomix का MCP सर्वर दो फ़ाइल सिस्टम टूल्स प्रदान करता है जो AI असिस्टेंट्स को स्थानीय फ़ाइल सिस्टम के साथ सुरक्षित रूप से इंटरैक्ट करने की अनुमति देते हैं:

1. `file_system_read_file`
  - पूर्ण पथों का उपयोग करके स्थानीय फ़ाइल सिस्टम से फ़ाइल सामग्री पढ़ता है
  - संवेदनशील जानकारी वाली फ़ाइलों तक पहुंच का पता लगाने और रोकने के लिए बिल्ट-इन सुरक्षा सत्यापन शामिल करता है
  - [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint) का उपयोग करके सुरक्षा सत्यापन लागू करता है
  - संवेदनशील जानकारी (API कीज़, पासवर्ड, सीक्रेट्स) वाली फ़ाइलों तक पहुंच को रोकता है
  - डायरेक्टरी ट्रैवर्सल हमलों को रोकने के लिए पूर्ण पथों को सत्यापित करता है
  - अमान्य पथों और सुरक्षा समस्याओं के लिए स्पष्ट त्रुटि संदेश वापस करता है

2. `file_system_read_directory`
  - पूर्ण पथ का उपयोग करके डायरेक्टरी की सामग्री सूचीबद्ध करता है
  - स्पष्ट संकेतकों के साथ फ़ाइलें और उप-डायरेक्टरी दिखाने वाली एक फॉर्मेटेड सूची वापस करता है
  - स्पष्ट संकेतकों (`[FILE]` या `[DIR]`) के साथ फ़ाइलें और डायरेक्टरी दिखाता है
  - उचित त्रुटि हैंडलिंग के साथ सुरक्षित डायरेक्टरी नेवीगेशन प्रदान करता है
  - पथों को सत्यापित करता है और सुनिश्चित करता है कि वे पूर्ण हैं
  - प्रोजेक्ट संरचना का अन्वेषण और कोडबेस संगठन की समझ के लिए उपयोगी

दोनों टूल्स मजबूत सुरक्षा उपाय शामिल करते हैं:
- डायरेक्टरी ट्रैवर्सल हमलों को रोकने के लिए पूर्ण पथ सत्यापन
- उचित पहुंच अधिकार सुनिश्चित करने के लिए अनुमति जांच
- संवेदनशील जानकारी का पता लगाने के लिए Secretlint के साथ एकीकरण
- बेहतर डीबगिंग और सुरक्षा जागरूकता के लिए स्पष्ट त्रुटि संदेश

**उदाहरण:**
```typescript
// फ़ाइल पढ़ना
const fileContent = await tools.file_system_read_file({
  path: '/absolute/path/to/file.txt'
});

// डायरेक्टरी सामग्री सूचीबद्ध करना
const dirContent = await tools.file_system_read_directory({
  path: '/absolute/path/to/directory'
});
```

ये टूल्स विशेष रूप से उपयोगी हैं जब AI असिस्टेंट्स को निम्नलिखित की आवश्यकता होती है:
- कोडबेस में विशिष्ट फ़ाइलों का विश्लेषण करना
- डायरेक्टरी संरचनाओं को नेविगेट करना
- फ़ाइलों की उपस्थिति और पहुंच की पुष्टि करना
- सुरक्षित फ़ाइल सिस्टम ऑपरेशन सुनिश्चित करना

## Repomix को MCP सर्वर के रूप में उपयोग करने के लाभ

Repomix को MCP सर्वर के रूप में उपयोग करने से कई फायदे मिलते हैं:

1. **प्रत्यक्ष एकीकरण**: AI असिस्टेंट्स मैन्युअल फ़ाइल तैयारी के बिना आपके कोडबेस का सीधे विश्लेषण कर सकते हैं।

### XML को डिफ़ॉल्ट फॉर्मेट के रूप में क्यों?

Repomix व्यापक अनुसंधान और परीक्षण के आधार पर XML को डिफ़ॉल्ट आउटपुट फॉर्मेट के रूप में उपयोग करता है। यह निर्णय अनुभवजन्य साक्ष्य और AI-सहायता प्राप्त कोड विश्लेषण के व्यावहारिक विचारों पर आधारित है।

XML का हमारा चुनाव मुख्य रूप से प्रमुख AI प्रदाताओं की आधिकारिक सिफारिशों से प्रभावित है:
- **Anthropic (Claude)**: प्रॉम्प्ट को संरचित करने के लिए XML टैग के उपयोग की स्पष्ट रूप से सिफारिश करता है, यह कहते हुए कि "Claude को प्रशिक्षण के दौरान ऐसे प्रॉम्प्ट का सामना हुआ था" ([दस्तावेज़](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/use-xml-tags))
- **Google (Gemini)**: जटिल कार्यों के लिए XML सहित संरचित फॉर्मेट की सिफारिश करता है ([दस्तावेज़](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/structure-prompts))
- **OpenAI (GPT)**: जटिल परिदृश्यों में संरचित प्रॉम्प्टिंग की वकालत करता है ([घोषणा](https://x.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1890147300493914437), [cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5_prompting_guide))

## मार्कडाउन फॉर्मेट

```bash
repomix --style markdown
```

मार्कडाउन पठनीय फॉर्मेटिंग प्रदान करता है:

````markdown
यह फ़ाइल संपूर्ण कोडबेस का मर्ज किया गया प्रतिनिधित्व है...

````

## JSON फॉर्मेट

```bash
repomix --style json
```

JSON फॉर्मेट camelCase प्रॉपर्टी नामों के साथ संरचित, प्रोग्रामेटिक रूप से सुलभ आउटपुट प्रदान करता है:

```json
{
  "fileSummary": {
    "generationHeader": "यह फ़ाइल संपूर्ण कोडबेस का मर्ज किया गया प्रतिनिधित्व है, जो Repomix द्वारा एक एकल दस्तावेज़ में संयोजित की गई है।",
    "purpose": "इस फ़ाइल में संपूर्ण रिपॉज़िटरी सामग्री का पैक किया गया प्रतिनिधित्व शामिल है...",
    "fileFormat": "सामग्री इस प्रकार व्यवस्थित है...",
    "usageGuidelines": "- इस फ़ाइल को केवल-पढ़ने के रूप में माना जाना चाहिए...",
    "notes": "- कुछ फ़ाइलें .gitignore नियमों के आधार पर बाहर रखी गई हो सकती हैं..."
  },
  "userProvidedHeader": "निर्दिष्ट होने पर कस्टम हेडर टेक्स्ट",
  "directoryStructure": "src/
  cli/
    cliOutput.ts
    index.ts
  config/
    configLoader.ts",
  "files": {
    "src/index.js": "// फ़ाइल सामग्री यहाँ",
    "src/utils.js": "// फ़ाइल सामग्री यहाँ"
  },
  "instruction": "instructionFilePath से कस्टम निर्देश"
}
```

### JSON फॉर्मेट के फायदे

JSON फॉर्मेट इसके लिए आदर्श है:
- **प्रोग्रामेटिक प्रोसेसिंग**: किसी भी प्रोग्रामिंग भाषा में JSON लाइब्रेरीज़ के साथ आसानी से पार्स और मैनिपुलेट करना
- **API एकीकरण**: वेब सेवाओं और एप्लिकेशन द्वारा प्रत्यक्ष उपभोग
- **AI टूल संगतता**: मशीन लर्निंग और AI सिस्टम के लिए अनुकूलित संरचित फॉर्मेट
- **डेटा विश्लेषण**: `jq` जैसे टूल का उपयोग करके विशिष्ट जानकारी का सीधा निकालना

### `jq` का उपयोग करके JSON आउटपुट के साथ काम करना

JSON फॉर्मेट विशिष्ट जानकारी को प्रोग्रामेटिक रूप से निकालना आसान बनाता है। यहाँ सामान्य उदाहरण हैं:

#### बुनियादी फ़ाइल ऑपरेशन
```bash
# सभी फ़ाइल पाथ सूचीबद्ध करें
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[]'

# कुल फ़ाइलों की संख्या गिनें
cat repomix-output.json | jq '.files | keys | length'

# विशिष्ट फ़ाइल सामग्री निकालें
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files["README.md"]'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files["src/index.js"]'
```

#### फ़ाइल फ़िल्टरिंग और विश्लेषण
```bash
# एक्सटेंशन के आधार पर फ़ाइलें खोजें
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(endswith(".ts"))'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(endswith(".js") or endswith(".ts"))'

# विशिष्ट टेक्स्ट युक्त फ़ाइलें प्राप्त करें
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | select(.value | contains("function")) | .key'

# कैरेक्टर काउंट के साथ फ़ाइल सूची बनाएं
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | "\(.key): \(.value | length) कैरेक्टर"'
```

#### मेटाडेटा निकालना
```bash
# डायरेक्टरी संरचना निकालें
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.directoryStructure'

# फ़ाइल सारांश जानकारी प्राप्त करें
cat repomix-output.json | jq '.fileSummary.purpose'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.fileSummary.generationHeader'

# उपयोगकर्ता प्रदान किया गया हेडर निकालें (यदि मौजूद है)
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.userProvidedHeader // "कोई हेडर प्रदान नहीं किया गया"'

# कस्टम निर्देश प्राप्त करें
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.instruction // "कोई निर्देश प्रदान नहीं किए गए"'
```

#### उन्नत विश्लेषण
```bash
# सामग्री लंबाई के अनुसार सबसे बड़ी फ़ाइलें खोजें
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | [.key, (.value | length)] | @tsv' | sort -k2 -nr | head -10

# विशिष्ट पैटर्न युक्त फ़ाइलें खोजें
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | select(.value | test("import.*react"; "i")) | .key'

# कई एक्सटेंशन से मेल खाते फ़ाइल पाथ निकालें
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(test("\.(js|ts|jsx|tsx)$"))'
```

## प्लेन टेक्स्ट फॉर्मेट

```bash
repomix --style plain
```

आउटपुट संरचना:
```text

# GitHub रिपॉजिटरी प्रोसेसिंग

Repomix आपको GitHub जैसे प्लेटफॉर्म पर होस्ट किए गए रिमोट रिपॉजिटरी को प्रोसेस करने की अनुमति देता है। यह सुविधा उपयोगी है जब आप अपने लोकल मशीन पर रिपॉजिटरी को क्लोन किए बिना कोडबेस का विश्लेषण करना चाहते हैं।

## रिमोट रिपॉजिटरी प्रोसेस करना

रिमोट रिपॉजिटरी प्रोसेस करने के लिए, `--remote` विकल्प का उपयोग करें:

```bash
repomix --remote <username>/<repository>
```

उदाहरण:

```bash
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix
```

यह GitHub से `yamadashy/repomix` रिपॉजिटरी को डाउनलोड करेगा और प्रोसेस करेगा।

## विशिष्ट ब्रांच या कमिट प्रोसेस करना

डिफॉल्ट रूप से, Repomix रिपॉजिटरी के डिफॉल्ट ब्रांच (आमतौर पर `main` या `master`) को प्रोसेस करेगा। विशिष्ट ब्रांच या कमिट प्रोसेस करने के लिए, `--remote-branch` विकल्प का उपयोग करें:

```bash
repomix --remote <username>/<repository> --remote-branch <branch-or-commit>
```

उदाहरण:

```bash
# विशिष्ट ब्रांच प्रोसेस करना
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix --remote-branch develop

# विशिष्ट कमिट प्रोसेस करना
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix --remote-branch 935b695
```

## आउटपुट विकल्प

रिमोट रिपॉजिटरी प्रोसेस करते समय, आप अन्य Repomix विकल्पों का उपयोग कर सकते हैं, जैसे आउटपुट स्टाइल और फिल्टरिंग:

```bash
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix --style markdown --output-file output.md
```

```bash
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix --include "src/**/*.ts" --ignore "**/*.test.ts"
```

## प्राइवेट रिपॉजिटरी

Repomix CLI टूल आपके लोकल Git क्रेडेंशियल्स का उपयोग करता है, इसलिए यदि आपके पास प्राइवेट रिपॉजिटरी तक पहुंच है, तो आप उन्हें भी प्रोसेस कर सकते हैं:

```bash
repomix --remote your-org/private-repo
```

## रिमोट प्रोसेसिंग के लाभ

रिमोट रिपॉजिटरी प्रोसेसिंग के कई लाभ हैं:

1. **डिस्क स्पेस बचाना**: आपको अपने लोकल मशीन पर रिपॉजिटरी को क्लोन करने की आवश्यकता नहीं है
2. **समय बचाना**: बड़े रिपॉजिटरी को क्लोन करने में समय लग सकता है
3. **सुविधा**: आपको Git इंस्टॉल करने या सेटअप करने की आवश्यकता नहीं है
4. **एक्सप्लोरेशन**: नए प्रोजेक्ट्स या ओपन सोर्स रिपॉजिटरी का त्वरित विश्लेषण

## रिमोट प्रोसेसिंग सीमाएं

रिमोट रिपॉजिटरी प्रोसेसिंग की कुछ सीमाएं हैं:

1. **नेटवर्क निर्भरता**: आपको इंटरनेट कनेक्शन की आवश्यकता है
2. **डाउनलोड समय**: बड़े रिपॉजिटरी को डाउनलोड करने में समय लग सकता है
3. **API सीमाएं**: GitHub API सीमाओं के अधीन है
4. **Git इतिहास**: वर्तमान में, Repomix केवल निर्दिष्ट ब्रांच या कमिट के स्नैपशॉट को प्रोसेस करता है, न कि पूरे Git इतिहास को

## उदाहरण उपयोग

### ओपन सोर्स प्रोजेक्ट का विश्लेषण

```bash
repomix --remote facebook/react --include "packages/react/**/*.js" --style markdown --output-file react-analysis.md
```

### विशिष्ट ब्रांच का विश्लेषण

```bash
repomix --remote tensorflow/tensorflow --remote-branch r2.9 --include "tensorflow/python/**/*.py" --output-file tensorflow-python-api.xml
```

### कमिट के बीच तुलना

आप विभिन्न कमिट्स के बीच तुलना करने के लिए Repomix का उपयोग कर सकते हैं:

```bash
# पहले कमिट को प्रोसेस करें
repomix --remote user/repo --remote-branch commit1 --output-file output1.xml

# दूसरे कमिट को प्रोसेस करें
repomix --remote user/repo --remote-branch commit2 --output-file output2.xml

# फिर आप दोनों आउटपुट फाइलों को AI मॉडल के साथ उपयोग कर सकते हैं
```

## File: website/client/src/hi/guide/security.md
`````markdown
# सुरक्षा

Repomix में एक अंतर्निहित सुरक्षा जांच प्रणाली है जो आपके कोडबेस में संवेदनशील जानकारी का पता लगाती है और आपको AI मॉडल के साथ साझा करने से पहले उन्हें हटाने या संशोधित करने की अनुमति देती है।

## सुरक्षा जांच कैसे काम करती है

जब आप Repomix चलाते हैं, तो यह आपके कोडबेस में निम्नलिखित प्रकार की संवेदनशील जानकारी की जांच करता है:

1. **API कुंजियां और टोकन**: AWS कुंजियां, GitHub टोकन, आदि
2. **क्रेडेंशियल**: पासवर्ड, प्रमाणीकरण टोकन
3. **प्राइवेट कुंजियां**: SSH कुंजियां, प्राइवेट कुंजियां
4. **कॉन्फिगरेशन फाइलें**: .env फाइलें, कॉन्फिगरेशन फाइलें जिनमें संवेदनशील जानकारी हो सकती है

## सुरक्षा जांच का उपयोग

सुरक्षा जांच डिफॉल्ट रूप से सक्षम है। आप इसे अक्षम कर सकते हैं, लेकिन यह अनुशंसित नहीं है:

```bash
repomix --no-security-check
```

## कॉन्फिगरेशन फाइल में सुरक्षा जांच

आप अपने `repomix.config.json` में भी सुरक्षा जांच को कॉन्फिगर कर सकते हैं:

```json
{
  "security": {
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

## सुरक्षा चेतावनियां

जब Repomix संवेदनशील जानकारी का पता लगाता है, तो यह आपको चेतावनी देगा और आपको विकल्प प्रदान करेगा:

1. **फाइल को छोड़ें**: संवेदनशील फाइल को आउटपुट से बाहर रखें
2. **संवेदनशील जानकारी को संशोधित करें**: संवेदनशील जानकारी को `[REDACTED]` से बदलें
3. **जारी रखें**: चेतावनी को अनदेखा करें और जारी रखें (अनुशंसित नहीं)

## सुरक्षा सर्वोत्तम प्रथाएं

Repomix का उपयोग करते समय सुरक्षा सर्वोत्तम प्रथाओं का पालन करें:

1. **सुरक्षा जांच सक्षम रखें**: सुरक्षा जांच को हमेशा सक्षम रखें
2. **.env फाइलें**: .env फाइलों को .gitignore में जोड़ें
3. **संवेदनशील फाइलें**: संवेदनशील फाइलों को `--ignore` विकल्प के साथ बाहर रखें
4. **कोड समीक्षा**: AI के साथ साझा करने से पहले आउटपुट की समीक्षा करें
5. **सीक्रेट मैनेजमेंट**: सीक्रेट मैनेजमेंट टूल का उपयोग करें जैसे AWS Secrets Manager या HashiCorp Vault

## सुरक्षा जांच सीमाएं

Repomix की सुरक्षा जांच व्यापक है, लेकिन इसकी कुछ सीमाएं हैं:

1. **पैटर्न मैचिंग**: यह पैटर्न मैचिंग पर निर्भर करता है और सभी संवेदनशील जानकारी का पता नहीं लगा सकता है
2. **एन्क्रिप्टेड सीक्रेट**: यह एन्क्रिप्टेड सीक्रेट का पता नहीं लगा सकता है
3. **कस्टम फॉर्मेट**: यह कस्टम फॉर्मेट में संवेदनशील जानकारी का पता नहीं लगा सकता है

`````markdown
# बुनियादी उपयोग

Repomix का उपयोग करना आसान है। यहां बताया गया है कि आप अपने कोडबेस को AI-फ्रेंडली फॉर्मेट में पैक करने के लिए इसका उपयोग कैसे कर सकते हैं।

## बुनियादी कमांड

अपने प्रोजेक्ट डायरेक्टरी में, बस निम्न कमांड चलाएं:

```bash
repomix
```

यह आपके वर्तमान डायरेक्टरी में एक `repomix-output.xml` फाइल जनरेट करेगा, जिसमें आपका पूरा रिपॉजिटरी AI-फ्रेंडली XML फॉर्मेट में होगा।

## विशिष्ट डायरेक्टरी को पैक करना

आप एक विशिष्ट डायरेक्टरी को पैक कर सकते हैं:

```bash
repomix path/to/directory
```

## विशिष्ट फाइलों को शामिल करना

आप [ग्लोब पैटर्न](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax) का उपयोग करके विशिष्ट फाइलों या डायरेक्टरी को शामिल कर सकते हैं:

```bash
repomix --include "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md"
```

## फाइलों को बाहर रखना

आप विशिष्ट फाइलों या डायरेक्टरी को बाहर रख सकते हैं:

```bash
repomix --ignore "**/*.log,tmp/"
```

## आउटपुट फॉर्मेट

आप विभिन्न आउटपुट फॉर्मेट में से चुन सकते हैं:

```bash
# XML फॉर्मेट (डिफॉल्ट)
repomix --style xml

# मार्कडाउन फॉर्मेट
repomix --style markdown

# JSON फॉर्मेट
repomix --style json

# प्लेन टेक्स्ट फॉर्मेट
repomix --style plain
```

## आउटपुट फाइल का नाम बदलना

आप आउटपुट फाइल का नाम बदल सकते हैं:

```bash
repomix --output-file custom-name.xml
```

## कॉन्फिगरेशन फाइल का उपयोग

आप एक कॉन्फिगरेशन फाइल बना सकते हैं जिसमें आपकी सभी सेटिंग्स हों:

```bash
repomix --init
```

यह आपके वर्तमान डायरेक्टरी में एक `repomix.config.json` फाइल बनाएगा। आप इसे अपनी आवश्यकताओं के अनुसार संपादित कर सकते हैं।

### कोड संपीड़न

```bash
repomix --compress

# आप इसे रिमोट रिपॉज़िटरी के साथ भी उपयोग कर सकते हैं:
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix --compress
```

### Git एकीकरण

AI विश्लेषण के लिए विकास संदर्भ प्रदान करने हेतु Git जानकारी शामिल करें:

```bash
# git diffs शामिल करें (अप्रतिबद्ध परिवर्तन)
repomix --include-diffs

# git कमिट logs शामिल करें (डिफ़ॉल्ट रूप से अंतिम 50 कमिट)
repomix --include-logs

# विशिष्ट संख्या में कमिट शामिल करें
repomix --include-logs --include-logs-count 10

# diffs और logs दोनों शामिल करें
repomix --include-diffs --include-logs
```

यह निम्नलिखित के बारे में महत्वपूर्ण संदर्भ जोड़ता है:
- **हाल के परिवर्तन**: Git diffs अप्रतिबद्ध संशोधन दिखाते हैं
- **विकास पैटर्न**: Git logs प्रकट करते हैं कि कौन सी फ़ाइलें आमतौर पर एक साथ बदली जाती हैं
- **कमिट इतिहास**: हाल के कमिट संदेश विकास फोकस में अंतर्दृष्टि प्रदान करते हैं
- **फ़ाइल संबंध**: समझना कि कौन सी फ़ाइलें एक ही कमिट में संशोधित होती हैं

### टोकन संख्या अनुकूलन

अपने कोडबेस के टोकन वितरण को समझना AI इंटरैक्शन को अनुकूलित करने के लिए महत्वपूर्ण है। अपने पूरे प्रोजेक्ट में टोकन उपयोग को देखने के लिए `--token-count-tree` विकल्प का उपयोग करें:

```bash
repomix --token-count-tree
```

यह टोकन गिनती के साथ आपके कोडबेस का पदानुक्रमित दृश्य प्रदर्शित करता है:

```
🔢 Token Count Tree:
────────────────────
└── src/ (70,925 tokens)
    ├── cli/ (12,714 tokens)
    │   ├── actions/ (7,546 tokens)
    │   └── reporters/ (990 tokens)
    └── core/ (41,600 tokens)
        ├── file/ (10,098 tokens)
        └── output/ (5,808 tokens)
```

आप बड़ी फ़ाइलों पर ध्यान केंद्रित करने के लिए न्यूनतम टोकन सीमा भी सेट कर सकते हैं:

```bash
repomix --token-count-tree 1000  # केवल 1000+ टोकन वाली फ़ाइलें/डायरेक्टरी दिखाएं
```

यह आपकी सहायता करता है:
- **टोकन-भारी फ़ाइलों की पहचान** - जो AI संदर्भ सीमा को पार कर सकती हैं
- **फ़ाइल चयन को अनुकूलित करना** - `--include` और `--ignore` पैटर्न का उपयोग करके
- **संपीड़न रणनीतियां योजना बनाना** - सबसे बड़े योगदानकर्ताओं को लक्षित करके
- **सामग्री बनाम संदर्भ संतुलन** - AI विश्लेषण के लिए कोड तैयार करते समय

## रिमोट रिपॉजिटरी को पैक करना

आप GitHub रिपॉजिटरी को सीधे पैक कर सकते हैं:

```bash
# शॉर्टहैंड फॉर्मेट का उपयोग करके
npx repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix

# पूर्ण URL का उपयोग करके
npx repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix
```

## फ़ाइल सूची इनपुट (stdin)

अधिकतम लचीलेपन के लिए stdin के माध्यम से फ़ाइल पथ पास करें:

```bash
# find कमांड का उपयोग करके
find src -name "*.ts" -type f | repomix --stdin

# git का उपयोग करके ट्रैक्ड फ़ाइलें प्राप्त करने के लिए
git ls-files "*.ts" | repomix --stdin

# विशिष्ट सामग्री वाली फ़ाइलें खोजने के लिए grep का उपयोग करके
grep -l "TODO" **/*.ts | repomix --stdin

# विशिष्ट सामग्री वाली फ़ाइलें खोजने के लिए ripgrep का उपयोग करके
rg -l "TODO|FIXME" --type ts | repomix --stdin

# फ़ाइलें खोजने के लिए ripgrep (rg) का उपयोग करके
rg --files --type ts | repomix --stdin

# फ़ाइलें खोजने के लिए sharkdp/fd का उपयोग करके
fd -e ts | repomix --stdin

# सभी फ़ाइलों से चुनने के लिए fzf का उपयोग करके
fzf -m | repomix --stdin

# fzf के साथ इंटरैक्टिव फ़ाइल चयन
find . -name "*.ts" -type f | fzf -m | repomix --stdin

# glob पैटर्न के साथ ls का उपयोग करके
ls src/**/*.ts | repomix --stdin

# फ़ाइल पथ वाली फ़ाइल से
cat file-list.txt | repomix --stdin

# echo के साथ प्रत्यक्ष इनपुट
echo -e "src/index.ts\nsrc/utils.ts" | repomix --stdin
```

`--stdin` विकल्प आपको फ़ाइल पथों की सूची को Repomix में पाइप करने की अनुमति देता है, जो आपको पैक करने के लिए फ़ाइलों का चयन करने में अधिकतम लचीलापन प्रदान करता है।

`--stdin` का उपयोग करते समय, निर्दिष्ट फ़ाइलें प्रभावी रूप से include पैटर्न में जोड़ी जाती हैं। इसका मतलब है कि सामान्य include और ignore व्यवहार अभी भी लागू होता है - stdin के माध्यम से निर्दिष्ट फ़ाइलें अभी भी बाहर रखी जाएंगी यदि वे ignore पैटर्न से मेल खाती हैं।

> [!NOTE]
> `--stdin` का उपयोग करते समय, फ़ाइल पथ सापेक्ष या पूर्ण हो सकते हैं, और Repomix स्वचालित रूप से पथ रिज़ॉल्यूशन और डुप्लिकेशन हैंडलिंग करेगा।

## AI के साथ आउटपुट का उपयोग

एक बार जब आपके पास पैक्ड फाइल है, तो आप इसे ChatGPT, Claude, या अन्य LLM के साथ उपयोग कर सकते हैं। बस फाइल को अपलोड करें और अपने प्रॉम्प्ट में इसका उल्लेख करें:

```
इस फाइल में मेरे रिपॉजिटरी की सभी फाइलें हैं। कृपया इसकी समीक्षा करें और मुझे बताएं कि क्या सुधार किए जा सकते हैं।
```

यह आप सभी के Repomix का उपयोग करने और समर्थन करने के बिना संभव नहीं होता। धन्यवाद!

## Repomix क्या है?

Repomix एक शक्तिशाली टूल है जो आपके पूरे कोडबेस को एक AI-फ्रेंडली फाइल में पैकेज करता है। चाहे आप कोड रिव्यू, रिफैक्टरिंग पर काम कर रहे हों या अपने प्रोजेक्ट के लिए AI सहायता की आवश्यकता हो, Repomix आपके पूरे रिपॉजिटरी कॉन्टेक्स्ट को AI टूल्स के साथ साझा करना आसान बनाता है।

<YouTubeVideo :videoId="VIDEO_IDS.REPOMIX_DEMO" />

## त्वरित शुरुआत

एक बार जब आप Repomix का उपयोग करके एक पैक्ड फाइल (`repomix-output.xml`) जनरेट कर लेते हैं, तो आप इसे एक AI असिस्टेंट (जैसे ChatGPT, Claude) को इस तरह के प्रॉम्प्ट के साथ भेज सकते हैं:

```
इस फाइल में रिपॉजिटरी की सभी फाइलें एक में संयोजित हैं।
मैं कोड को रिफैक्टर करना चाहता हूं, इसलिए कृपया पहले इसकी समीक्षा करें।
```

AI आपके पूरे कोडबेस का विश्लेषण करेगा और व्यापक अंतर्दृष्टि प्रदान करेगा:

पूरे कोडबेस के संदर्भ के रूप में उपलब्ध होने के साथ, Repomix कार्यान्वयन योजना, बग जांच, तृतीय-पक्ष लाइब्रेरी सुरक्षा जांच, दस्तावेज़ीकरण निर्माण, और भी बहुत कुछ सहित अनुप्रयोगों की एक विस्तृत श्रृंखला को सक्षम बनाता है।

## CLI टूल का उपयोग {#using-the-cli-tool}

Repomix को कमांड-लाइन टूल के रूप में उपयोग किया जा सकता है, जो शक्तिशाली सुविधाएँ और अनुकूलन विकल्प प्रदान करता है।

**CLI टूल प्राइवेट रिपॉजिटरी तक पहुंच सकता है** क्योंकि यह आपके स्थानीय रूप से इंस्टॉल किए गए git का उपयोग करता है।

### त्वरित शुरुआत

आप Repomix को अपने प्रोजेक्ट डायरेक्टरी में बिना इंस्टॉलेशन के तुरंत आजमा सकते हैं:

```bash
npx repomix@latest
```

या बार-बार उपयोग के लिए ग्लोबली इंस्टॉल करें:

```bash
# npm का उपयोग करके इंस्टॉल करें
npm install -g repomix

# या yarn के साथ
yarn global add repomix

# या bun के साथ
bun add -g repomix

# या Homebrew के साथ (macOS/Linux)
brew install repomix

# फिर किसी भी प्रोजेक्ट डायरेक्टरी में चलाएं
repomix
```

बस इतना ही! Repomix आपकी वर्तमान डायरेक्टरी में एक `repomix-output.xml` फाइल जनरेट करेगा, जिसमें आपका पूरा रिपॉजिटरी AI-फ्रेंडली फॉर्मेट में होगा।



### उपयोग

अपने पूरे रिपॉजिटरी को पैक करने के लिए:

```bash
repomix
```

किसी विशिष्ट डायरेक्टरी को पैक करने के लिए:

```bash
repomix path/to/directory
```

[ग्लोब पैटर्न](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax) का उपयोग करके विशिष्ट फाइलों या डायरेक्टरी को पैक करने के लिए:

```bash
repomix --include "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md"
```

विशिष्ट फाइलों या डायरेक्टरी को बाहर रखने के लिए:

```bash
repomix --ignore "**/*.log,tmp/"
```

रिमोट रिपॉजिटरी को पैक करने के लिए:
```bash
# शॉर्टहैंड फॉर्मेट का उपयोग करके
npx repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix

# पूर्ण URL का उपयोग करके (ब्रांच और विशिष्ट पाथ का समर्थन करता है)
npx repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix
npx repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/tree/main

# कमिट के URL का उपयोग करके
npx repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/commit/836...
```

एक नई कॉन्फिगरेशन फाइल (`repomix.config.json`) को इनिशियलाइज़ करने के लिए:

```bash
repomix --init
```

एक बार जब आप पैक्ड फाइल जनरेट कर लेते हैं, तो आप इसे Claude, ChatGPT और Gemini जैसे जनरेटिव AI टूल के साथ उपयोग कर सकते हैं।

#### Docker उपयोग

आप Docker 🐳 का उपयोग करके भी Repomix चला सकते हैं  
यह उपयोगी है यदि आप Repomix को एक अलग वातावरण में चलाना चाहते हैं या कंटेनर का उपयोग करना पसंद करते हैं।

बेसिक उपयोग (वर्तमान डायरेक्टरी):

```bash
docker run -v .:/app -it --rm ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix
```

किसी विशिष्ट डायरेक्टरी को पैक करने के लिए:
```bash
docker run -v .:/app -it --rm ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix path/to/directory
```

रिमोट रिपॉजिटरी को प्रोसेस करें और `output` डायरेक्टरी में आउटपुट करें:

```bash
docker run -v ./output:/app -it --rm ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix
```

### आउटपुट फॉर्मेट

# Pembuatan Agent Skills

Repomix dapat menghasilkan output dalam format [Claude Agent Skills](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills), membuat direktori Skills terstruktur yang dapat digunakan sebagai referensi codebase yang dapat digunakan kembali untuk asisten AI.

Fitur ini sangat powerful ketika Anda ingin mereferensikan implementasi dari repository jarak jauh. Dengan menghasilkan Skills dari proyek open source, Anda dapat dengan mudah meminta Claude untuk mereferensikan pola atau implementasi tertentu saat mengerjakan kode Anda sendiri.

Alih-alih menghasilkan satu file yang dikemas, pembuatan Skills membuat direktori terstruktur dengan beberapa file referensi yang dioptimalkan untuk pemahaman AI dan pencarian yang kompatibel dengan grep.

> [!NOTE]
> Ini adalah fitur eksperimental. Format output dan opsi dapat berubah di rilis mendatang berdasarkan umpan balik pengguna.

## Penggunaan Dasar

Hasilkan Skills dari direktori lokal Anda:

```bash
# Hasilkan Skills dari direktori saat ini
repomix --skill-generate

# Hasilkan dengan nama Skills kustom
repomix --skill-generate my-project-reference

# Hasilkan dari direktori tertentu
repomix path/to/directory --skill-generate

# Hasilkan dari repository jarak jauh
repomix --remote https://github.com/user/repo --skill-generate
```

## Pemilihan Lokasi Skills

Saat Anda menjalankan perintah, Repomix meminta Anda untuk memilih tempat menyimpan Skills:

1. **Personal Skills** (`~/.claude/skills/`) - Tersedia di semua proyek di mesin Anda
2. **Project Skills** (`.claude/skills/`) - Dibagikan dengan tim Anda via git

Jika direktori Skills sudah ada, Anda akan diminta untuk mengkonfirmasi penimpaan.

> [!TIP]
> Saat menghasilkan Project Skills, pertimbangkan untuk menambahkannya ke `.gitignore` untuk menghindari commit file besar:
> ```gitignore
> .claude/skills/repomix-reference-*/
> ```

## Struktur yang Dihasilkan

Skills dihasilkan dengan struktur berikut:

```text
.claude/skills/<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md                    # Metadata utama Skills & dokumentasi

Terdeteksi dari file seperti: `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `.nvmrc`, `pyproject.toml`, dll.

## Nama Skills yang Dihasilkan Otomatis

Jika tidak ada nama yang diberikan, Repomix otomatis menghasilkan satu dengan pola ini:

```bash
repomix src/ --skill-generate                # → repomix-reference-src
repomix --remote user/repo --skill-generate  # → repomix-reference-repo
repomix --skill-generate CustomName          # → custom-name (dinormalisasi ke kebab-case)
```

Nama Skills akan:
- Dikonversi ke kebab-case (huruf kecil, dipisahkan tanda hubung)
- Dibatasi maksimal 64 karakter
- Dilindungi terhadap path traversal

## Integrasi dengan Opsi Repomix

Pembuatan Skills menghormati semua opsi standar Repomix:

```bash
# Hasilkan Skills dengan pemfilteran file
repomix --skill-generate --include "src/**/*.ts" --ignore "**/*.test.ts"

# Hasilkan Skills dengan kompresi
repomix --skill-generate --compress

# Hasilkan Skills dari repository jarak jauh
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix --skill-generate

# Hasilkan Skills dengan opsi format output tertentu
repomix --skill-generate --remove-comments --remove-empty-lines
```

### Skills Hanya Dokumentasi

Menggunakan `--include`, Anda dapat menghasilkan Skills yang hanya berisi dokumentasi dari repository GitHub. Ini berguna ketika Anda ingin Claude mereferensikan dokumentasi library atau framework tertentu saat mengerjakan kode Anda:

```bash
# Dokumentasi Claude Code Action
repomix --remote https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action --include docs --skill-generate

# Dokumentasi Vite
repomix --remote https://github.com/vitejs/vite --include docs --skill-generate

# Dokumentasi React
repomix --remote https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev --include src/content --skill-generate
```

## Keterbatasan

Opsi `--skill-generate` tidak dapat digunakan dengan:
- `--stdout` - Output Skills memerlukan penulisan ke filesystem
- `--copy` - Output Skills adalah direktori, tidak dapat disalin ke clipboard

## Menggunakan Skills yang Dihasilkan

Setelah dihasilkan, Anda dapat menggunakan Skills dengan Claude:

1. **Claude Code**: Skills otomatis tersedia jika disimpan ke `~/.claude/skills/` atau `.claude/skills/`
2. **Claude Web**: Unggah direktori Skills ke Claude untuk analisis codebase
3. **Berbagi Tim**: Commit `.claude/skills/` ke repository Anda untuk akses seluruh tim

## Contoh Alur Kerja

### Membuat Library Referensi Pribadi

```bash
# Clone dan analisis proyek open source yang menarik
repomix --remote facebook/react --skill-generate react-reference

# Skills disimpan ke ~/.claude/skills/react-reference/
# Sekarang Anda dapat mereferensikan codebase React dalam percakapan Claude mana pun
```

### Dokumentasi Proyek Tim

```bash
# Di direktori proyek Anda
cd my-project

# Hasilkan Skills untuk tim Anda
repomix --skill-generate

# Pilih "Project Skills" saat diminta
# Skills disimpan ke .claude/skills/repomix-reference-my-project/

# Commit dan bagikan dengan tim Anda
git add .claude/skills/
git commit -m "Add codebase reference Skills"
```

## File: website/client/src/id/guide/code-compress.md
`````markdown
# Kompresi Kode


Kompresi kode adalah fitur yang kuat yang secara cerdas mengekstrak struktur kode esensial sambil menghapus detail implementasi. Ini sangat berguna untuk mengurangi jumlah token sambil mempertahankan informasi struktural penting tentang basis kode Anda.

> [!NOTE]  
> Ini adalah fitur eksperimental yang akan kami tingkatkan secara aktif berdasarkan umpan balik pengguna dan penggunaan dunia nyata

## Penggunaan Dasar

Aktifkan kompresi kode menggunakan flag `--compress`:

```bash
repomix --compress
```

Anda juga dapat menggunakannya dengan repositori jarak jauh:

```bash
repomix --remote user/repo --compress
```

## Cara Kerjanya

Algoritma kompresi memproses kode menggunakan parsing tree-sitter untuk mengekstrak dan mempertahankan elemen struktural esensial sambil menghapus detail implementasi.

Kompresi mempertahankan:
- Tanda tangan fungsi dan metode
- Definisi antarmuka dan tipe
- Struktur dan properti kelas
- Elemen struktural penting

Sambil menghapus:
- Implementasi fungsi dan metode
- Detail logika perulangan dan kondisional
- Deklarasi variabel internal
- Kode spesifik implementasi

### Contoh

Kode TypeScript asli:

```typescript
import { ShoppingItem } from './shopping-item';

/**
 * Calculate the total price of shopping items
 */
const calculateTotal = (
  items: ShoppingItem[]
) => {
  let total = 0;
  for (const item of items) {
    total += item.price * item.quantity;
  }
  return total;
}

// Shopping item interface
interface Item {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  quantity: number;
}
```

Setelah kompresi:

```typescript
import { ShoppingItem } from './shopping-item';
⋮----
/**
 * Calculate the total price of shopping items
 */
const calculateTotal = (
  items: ShoppingItem[]
) => {
⋮----
// Shopping item interface
interface Item {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  quantity: number;
}
```

## Konfigurasi

Anda dapat mengaktifkan kompresi dalam file konfigurasi Anda:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "compress": true
  }
}
```

## Kasus Penggunaan

Kompresi kode sangat berguna ketika:
- Menganalisis struktur dan arsitektur kode
- Mengurangi jumlah token untuk pemrosesan LLM
- Membuat dokumentasi tingkat tinggi
- Memahami pola dan tanda tangan kode
- Berbagi desain API dan antarmuka

## Opsi Terkait

Anda dapat menggabungkan kompresi dengan opsi lain:
- `--remove-comments`: Menghapus komentar kode
- `--remove-empty-lines`: Menghapus baris kosong
- `--output-show-line-numbers`: Menambahkan nomor baris ke output

`````markdown
# Penghapusan Komentar


Repomix menyediakan opsi untuk menghapus komentar dari kode sumber Anda sebelum mengemas. Ini dapat membantu mengurangi ukuran output dan mengurangi jumlah token yang digunakan oleh model AI.

## Penggunaan Dasar

Untuk menghapus komentar dari output, gunakan flag `--remove-comments`:

```bash
repomix --remove-comments
```

## Konfigurasi

Anda juga dapat mengaktifkan penghapusan komentar dalam file konfigurasi Anda:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "removeComments": true
  }
}
```

## Apa yang Dihapus

Ketika penghapusan komentar diaktifkan, Repomix akan menghapus:

- Komentar baris tunggal (misalnya, `// komentar ini`)
- Komentar multi-baris (misalnya, `/* komentar ini */`)
- Komentar dokumentasi (misalnya, `/** dokumentasi ini */`)

## Pertimbangan

Meskipun menghapus komentar dapat mengurangi jumlah token, perlu diingat bahwa komentar sering berisi informasi berharga tentang kode, seperti:

- Penjelasan tentang algoritma kompleks
- Alasan di balik keputusan implementasi
- Dokumentasi API
- Petunjuk untuk pengembang masa depan

Pertimbangkan dengan hati-hati apakah Anda ingin menghapus komentar berdasarkan kasus penggunaan spesifik Anda.

## Kasus Penggunaan

Penghapusan komentar paling berguna ketika:

- Anda perlu mengurangi jumlah token untuk model AI dengan konteks terbatas
- Komentar dalam kode Anda tidak memberikan nilai tambah yang signifikan
- Anda ingin fokus hanya pada kode yang dapat dieksekusi

Jika komentar Anda berisi informasi penting yang membantu memahami kode, Anda mungkin ingin mempertahankannya.

## File: website/client/src/id/guide/configuration.md
`````markdown
# Konfigurasi

Repomix dapat dikonfigurasi menggunakan file konfigurasi atau opsi baris perintah. File konfigurasi memungkinkan Anda untuk menyesuaikan berbagai aspek cara pemrosesan dan output codebase Anda.

## Format File Konfigurasi

Repomix mendukung beberapa format file konfigurasi untuk fleksibilitas dan kemudahan penggunaan.

Repomix akan secara otomatis mencari file konfigurasi dalam urutan prioritas berikut:

1. **TypeScript** (`repomix.config.ts`, `repomix.config.mts`, `repomix.config.cts`)
2. **JavaScript/ES Module** (`repomix.config.js`, `repomix.config.mjs`, `repomix.config.cjs`)
3. **JSON** (`repomix.config.json5`, `repomix.config.jsonc`, `repomix.config.json`)

### Konfigurasi JSON

Buat file konfigurasi di direktori proyek Anda:
```bash
repomix --init
```

Ini akan membuat file `repomix.config.json` dengan pengaturan default. Anda juga dapat membuat file konfigurasi global yang akan digunakan sebagai fallback ketika tidak ada konfigurasi lokal yang ditemukan:

```bash
repomix --init --global
```

### Konfigurasi TypeScript

File konfigurasi TypeScript memberikan pengalaman developer terbaik dengan pengecekan tipe lengkap dan dukungan IDE.

**Instalasi:**

Untuk menggunakan konfigurasi TypeScript atau JavaScript dengan `defineConfig`, Anda perlu menginstal Repomix sebagai dev dependency:

```bash
npm install -D repomix
```

**Contoh:**

```typescript
// repomix.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'repomix';

export default defineConfig({
  output: {
    filePath: 'output.xml',
    style: 'xml',
    removeComments: true,
  },
  ignore: {
    customPatterns: ['**/node_modules/**', '**/dist/**'],
  },
});
```

**Manfaat:**
- ✅ Pengecekan tipe TypeScript lengkap di IDE Anda
- ✅ Autocomplete dan IntelliSense IDE yang sangat baik
- ✅ Gunakan nilai dinamis (timestamp, environment variables, dll.)

**Contoh Nilai Dinamis:**

```typescript
// repomix.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'repomix';

// Generate nama file berbasis timestamp
const timestamp = new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 19).replace(/[:.]/g, '-');

export default defineConfig({
  output: {
    filePath: `output-${timestamp}.xml`,
    style: 'xml',
  },
});
```

### Konfigurasi JavaScript

File konfigurasi JavaScript bekerja sama seperti TypeScript, mendukung `defineConfig` dan nilai dinamis.

Lihat [tiktoken model.py](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken/blob/main/tiktoken/model.py#L24) untuk detail | `"o200k_base"`         |

File konfigurasi mendukung sintaks [JSON5](https://json5.org/), yang memungkinkan:
- Komentar (baik single-line maupun multi-line)
- Trailing comma dalam objek dan array
- Nama properti tanpa tanda kutip
- Sintaks string yang lebih fleksibel

## Validasi Skema

Anda dapat mengaktifkan validasi skema untuk file konfigurasi Anda dengan menambahkan properti `$schema`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://repomix.com/schemas/latest/schema.json",
  "output": {
    "filePath": "repomix-output.md",
    "style": "markdown"
  }
}
```

Ini menyediakan auto-completion dan validasi di editor yang mendukung skema JSON.

## Contoh File Konfigurasi

Berikut adalah contoh file konfigurasi lengkap (`repomix.config.json`):

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://repomix.com/schemas/latest/schema.json",
  "input": {
    "maxFileSize": 50000000
  },
  "output": {
    "filePath": "repomix-output.xml",
    "style": "xml",
    "parsableStyle": false,
    "compress": false,

      "sortByChangesMaxCommits": 100,
      "includeDiffs": false,
      "includeLogs": false,
      "includeLogsCount": 50
    }
  },
  "include": ["**/*"],
  "ignore": {
    "useGitignore": true,
    "useDefaultPatterns": true,
    // Pola juga dapat ditentukan di .repomixignore

  },
  "security": {
    "enableSecurityCheck": true
  },
  "tokenCount": {
    "encoding": "o200k_base"
  }
}
```

## Lokasi File Konfigurasi

Repomix mencari file konfigurasi dalam urutan berikut:
1. File konfigurasi lokal di direktori saat ini (urutan prioritas: TS > JS > JSON)
   - TypeScript: `repomix.config.ts`, `repomix.config.mts`, `repomix.config.cts`
   - JavaScript: `repomix.config.js`, `repomix.config.mjs`, `repomix.config.cjs`
   - JSON: `repomix.config.json5`, `repomix.config.jsonc`, `repomix.config.json`
2. File konfigurasi global (urutan prioritas: TS > JS > JSON)
   - Windows:
     - TypeScript: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.ts`, `.mts`, `.cts`
     - JavaScript: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`
     - JSON: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.json5`, `.jsonc`, `.json`
   - macOS/Linux:
     - TypeScript: `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.ts`, `.mts`, `.cts`
     - JavaScript: `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`
     - JSON: `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.json5`, `.jsonc`, `.json`

Opsi baris perintah memiliki prioritas lebih tinggi daripada pengaturan file konfigurasi.

## Pola Ignore

Repomix menyediakan beberapa cara untuk menentukan file mana yang harus diabaikan:

- **.gitignore**: Secara default, pola yang tercantum dalam file `.gitignore` dan `.git/info/exclude` proyek digunakan. Perilaku ini dapat dikontrol dengan pengaturan `ignore.useGitignore` atau opsi CLI `--no-gitignore`.
- **.ignore**: Anda dapat menggunakan file `.ignore` di direktori root proyek, mengikuti format yang sama dengan `.gitignore`. File ini digunakan oleh alat seperti ripgrep dan the silver searcher, mengurangi kebutuhan untuk memelihara beberapa file ignore. Perilaku ini dapat dikontrol dengan pengaturan `ignore.useDotIgnore` atau opsi CLI `--no-dot-ignore`.
- **Pola default**: Repomix menyertakan daftar default file dan direktori yang biasanya dikecualikan (misalnya node_modules, .git, file biner). Fitur ini dapat dikontrol dengan pengaturan `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` atau opsi CLI `--no-default-patterns`. Silakan lihat [defaultIgnore.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/src/config/defaultIgnore.ts) untuk detail lebih lanjut.
- **.repomixignore**: Anda dapat membuat file `.repomixignore` di direktori root proyek untuk mendefinisikan pola ignore khusus Repomix. File ini mengikuti format yang sama dengan `.gitignore`.
- **Pola kustom**: Pola ignore tambahan dapat ditentukan menggunakan opsi `ignore.customPatterns` dalam file konfigurasi. Anda dapat menimpa pengaturan ini dengan opsi baris perintah `-i, --ignore`.

**Urutan prioritas** (dari tinggi ke rendah):

1. Pola kustom (`ignore.customPatterns`)
2. File ignore (`.repomixignore`, `.ignore`, `.gitignore`, dan `.git/info/exclude`):
   - Ketika berada di direktori bersarang, file di direktori yang lebih dalam memiliki prioritas lebih tinggi
   - Ketika berada di direktori yang sama, file-file ini digabungkan tanpa urutan tertentu
3. Pola default (jika `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` adalah true dan tidak menggunakan `--no-default-patterns`)

Contoh `.repomixignore`:
```text
# Direktori cache
.cache/
tmp/

# Output build
dist/
build/

# Log
*.log
```

## Pola Ignore Default

Ketika `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` adalah true, Repomix secara otomatis mengabaikan pola umum:
```text
node_modules/**
.git/**
coverage/**
dist/**
```

Untuk daftar lengkap, lihat [defaultIgnore.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/src/config/defaultIgnore.ts)

## Fitur Lanjutan

### Kompresi Kode

Fitur kompresi kode, diaktifkan dengan `output.compress: true`, menggunakan [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) untuk secara cerdas mengekstrak struktur kode penting sambil menghapus detail implementasi. Ini membantu mengurangi jumlah token sambil mempertahankan informasi struktural penting.

Manfaat utama:
- Mengurangi jumlah token secara signifikan
- Mempertahankan signature kelas dan fungsi
- Memelihara import dan export
- Menjaga definisi tipe dan interface
- Menghapus body fungsi dan detail implementasi

Untuk detail dan contoh lebih lanjut, lihat [Panduan Kompresi Kode](code-compress).

### Integrasi Git

Konfigurasi `output.git` menyediakan fitur Git-aware yang kuat:

- `sortByChanges`: Ketika true, file diurutkan berdasarkan jumlah perubahan Git (commit yang memodifikasi file). File dengan lebih banyak perubahan muncul di bagian bawah output. Ini membantu memprioritaskan file yang lebih aktif dikembangkan. Default: `true`
- `sortByChangesMaxCommits`: Jumlah maksimum commit untuk dianalisis saat menghitung perubahan file. Default: `100`
- `includeDiffs`: Ketika true, menyertakan perbedaan Git dalam output (termasuk perubahan work tree dan staged secara terpisah). Ini memungkinkan pembaca melihat perubahan yang tertunda di repository. Default: `false`
- `includeLogs`: Ketika true, menyertakan riwayat commit Git dalam output. Menampilkan tanggal commit, pesan, dan jalur file untuk setiap commit. Ini membantu AI memahami pola pengembangan dan hubungan file. Default: `false`
- `includeLogsCount`: Jumlah commit terbaru yang akan disertakan dalam log git. Default: `50`

Contoh konfigurasi:
```json
{
  "output": {
    "git": {
      "sortByChanges": true,
      "sortByChangesMaxCommits": 100,
      "includeDiffs": true,
      "includeLogs": true,
      "includeLogsCount": 25
    }
  }
}
```

### Pemeriksaan Keamanan

Ketika `security.enableSecurityCheck` diaktifkan, Repomix menggunakan [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint) untuk mendeteksi informasi sensitif dalam codebase Anda sebelum memasukkannya dalam output. Ini membantu mencegah paparan yang tidak disengaja dari:

- Kunci API
- Token akses
- Kunci pribadi
- Password
- Kredensial sensitif lainnya

### Penghapusan Komentar

Ketika `output.removeComments` diset ke `true`, komentar dihapus dari jenis file yang didukung untuk mengurangi ukuran output dan fokus pada konten kode penting. Ini dapat sangat berguna ketika:

- Bekerja dengan kode yang banyak didokumentasikan
- Mencoba mengurangi jumlah token
- Fokus pada struktur dan logika kode

Untuk bahasa yang didukung dan contoh detail, lihat [Panduan Penghapusan Komentar](comment-removal).

# Instruksi Khusus


Repomix memungkinkan Anda menambahkan instruksi khusus ke output yang dihasilkan. Ini berguna untuk memberikan konteks tambahan atau petunjuk kepada model AI tentang cara memahami atau menggunakan basis kode Anda.

## Penggunaan Dasar

Untuk menambahkan instruksi khusus, gunakan flag `--instructions`:

```bash
repomix --instructions "Ini adalah proyek React yang menggunakan TypeScript. Perhatikan pola komponen yang digunakan."
```

## Menggunakan File Instruksi

Untuk instruksi yang lebih panjang atau kompleks, Anda dapat menyimpannya dalam file dan mereferensikannya:

```bash
repomix --instructions-file path/to/instructions.txt
```

## Konfigurasi

Anda juga dapat menentukan instruksi dalam file konfigurasi Anda:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "instructions": "Ini adalah proyek React yang menggunakan TypeScript. Perhatikan pola komponen yang digunakan."
  }
}
```

Atau menggunakan file instruksi:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "instructionsFile": "path/to/instructions.txt"
  }
}
```

## Praktik Terbaik

Saat menulis instruksi khusus, pertimbangkan hal berikut:

1. **Berikan konteks proyek**: Jelaskan tujuan, arsitektur, dan teknologi utama yang digunakan.
2. **Sorot area penting**: Arahkan perhatian ke bagian kode yang paling relevan.
3. **Jelaskan konvensi**: Jelaskan pola penamaan, struktur, atau konvensi khusus yang digunakan.
4. **Tentukan tujuan**: Jelaskan apa yang Anda harapkan dari model AI (misalnya, refaktor, analisis, dokumentasi).
5. **Berikan contoh**: Jika memungkinkan, berikan contoh jenis respons yang Anda harapkan.

Instruksi yang jelas dan spesifik akan membantu model AI memberikan respons yang lebih berguna dan relevan.

# Server MCP

Repomix mendukung [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), memungkinkan asisten AI untuk berinteraksi langsung dengan codebase Anda. Ketika dijalankan sebagai server MCP, Repomix menyediakan tools yang memungkinkan asisten AI untuk mengemas repository lokal atau remote untuk analisis tanpa memerlukan persiapan file manual.

> [!NOTE]  
> Ini adalah fitur eksperimental yang akan kami tingkatkan secara aktif berdasarkan feedback pengguna dan penggunaan dunia nyata

## Menjalankan Repomix sebagai Server MCP

Untuk menjalankan Repomix sebagai server MCP, gunakan flag `--mcp`:

```bash
repomix --mcp
```

Ini memulai Repomix dalam mode server MCP, membuatnya tersedia untuk asisten AI yang mendukung Model Context Protocol.

## Konfigurasi Server MCP

Untuk menggunakan Repomix sebagai server MCP dengan asisten AI seperti Claude, Anda perlu mengkonfigurasi pengaturan MCP:

### Untuk VS Code

Anda dapat menginstal server MCP Repomix di VS Code menggunakan salah satu metode berikut:

1. **Menggunakan badge instalasi:**

  [![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-VS_Code?style=flat-square&label=Install%20Server&color=0098FF)](vscode:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22repomix%22%2C%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22repomix%22%2C%22--mcp%22%5D%7D)<br>
  [![Install in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-VS_Code_Insiders?style=flat-square&label=Install%20Server&color=24bfa5)](vscode-insiders:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22repomix%22%2C%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22repomix%22%2C%22--mcp%22%5D%7D)

2. **Menggunakan command line:**

  ```bash
  code --add-mcp '{"name":"repomix","command":"npx","args":["-y","repomix","--mcp"]}'
  ```

  Untuk VS Code Insiders:
  ```bash
  code-insiders --add-mcp '{"name":"repomix","command":"npx","args":["-y","repomix","--mcp"]}'
  ```

### Untuk Cline (ekstensi VS Code)

Edit file `cline_mcp_settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "repomix": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "repomix",
        "--mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Untuk Cursor

Di Cursor, tambahkan server MCP baru dari `Cursor Settings` > `MCP` > `+ Add new global MCP server` dengan konfigurasi serupa dengan Cline.

### Untuk Claude Desktop

Edit file `claude_desktop_config.json` dengan konfigurasi serupa dengan Cline.

### Untuk Claude Code

Untuk mengkonfigurasi Repomix sebagai server MCP di [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview), gunakan perintah berikut:

```bash
claude mcp add repomix -- npx -y repomix --mcp
```

Sebagai alternatif, Anda dapat menggunakan **plugin Repomix resmi** untuk pengalaman yang lebih nyaman. Plugin menyediakan perintah bahasa alami dan pengaturan yang lebih mudah. Lihat dokumentasi [Plugin Claude Code](/id/guide/claude-code-plugins) untuk detail.

### Menggunakan Docker sebagai pengganti npx

Sebagai pengganti menggunakan npx, Anda dapat menggunakan Docker untuk menjalankan Repomix sebagai server MCP:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "repomix-docker": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",

## Tools MCP yang Tersedia

Ketika dijalankan sebagai server MCP, Repomix menyediakan tools berikut:

### pack_codebase

Tool ini mengemas direktori kode lokal ke dalam file XML untuk analisis AI. Tool ini menganalisis struktur codebase, mengekstrak konten kode yang relevan, dan menghasilkan laporan komprehensif termasuk metrik, pohon file, dan konten kode yang diformat.

**Parameter:**
- `directory`: (Wajib) Path absolut ke direktori yang akan dikemas
- `compress`: (Opsional, default: false) Mengaktifkan kompresi Tree-sitter untuk mengekstrak signature kode esensial dan struktur sambil menghapus detail implementasi. Mengurangi penggunaan token sekitar 70% sambil mempertahankan makna semantik. Umumnya tidak diperlukan karena grep_repomix_output memungkinkan pengambilan konten incremental. Gunakan hanya ketika Anda khusus membutuhkan konten codebase lengkap untuk repository besar.
- `includePatterns`: (Opsional) Menentukan file yang akan disertakan menggunakan pola fast-glob. Beberapa pola dapat dipisahkan dengan koma (contoh: "**/*.{js,ts}", "src/**,docs/**"). Hanya file yang cocok yang akan diproses.
- `ignorePatterns`: (Opsional) Menentukan file tambahan yang akan dikecualikan menggunakan pola fast-glob. Beberapa pola dapat dipisahkan dengan koma (contoh: "test/**,*.spec.js", "node_modules/**,dist/**"). Pola ini melengkapi .gitignore dan eksklusi built-in.
- `topFilesLength`: (Opsional, default: 10) Jumlah file terbesar berdasarkan ukuran untuk ditampilkan dalam ringkasan metrik untuk analisis codebase.

**Contoh:**
```json
{
  "directory": "/path/to/your/project",
  "compress": false,
  "includePatterns": "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md",
  "ignorePatterns": "**/*.log,tmp/",
  "topFilesLength": 10
}
```

### pack_remote_repository

Tool ini mengambil, mengkloning, dan mengemas repository GitHub ke dalam file XML untuk analisis AI. Tool ini secara otomatis mengkloning repository remote, menganalisis strukturnya, dan menghasilkan laporan komprehensif.

**Parameter:**
- `remote`: (Wajib) URL repository GitHub atau format user/repo (contoh: "yamadashy/repomix", "https://github.com/user/repo", atau "https://github.com/user/repo/tree/branch")
- `compress`: (Opsional, default: false) Mengaktifkan kompresi Tree-sitter untuk mengekstrak signature kode esensial dan struktur sambil menghapus detail implementasi. Mengurangi penggunaan token sekitar 70% sambil mempertahankan makna semantik. Umumnya tidak diperlukan karena grep_repomix_output memungkinkan pengambilan konten incremental. Gunakan hanya ketika Anda khusus membutuhkan konten codebase lengkap untuk repository besar.
- `includePatterns`: (Opsional) Menentukan file yang akan disertakan menggunakan pola fast-glob. Beberapa pola dapat dipisahkan dengan koma (contoh: "**/*.{js,ts}", "src/**,docs/**"). Hanya file yang cocok yang akan diproses.
- `ignorePatterns`: (Opsional) Menentukan file tambahan yang akan dikecualikan menggunakan pola fast-glob. Beberapa pola dapat dipisahkan dengan koma (contoh: "test/**,*.spec.js", "node_modules/**,dist/**"). Pola ini melengkapi .gitignore dan eksklusi built-in.
- `topFilesLength`: (Opsional, default: 10) Jumlah file terbesar berdasarkan ukuran untuk ditampilkan dalam ringkasan metrik untuk analisis codebase.

**Contoh:**
```json
{
  "remote": "yamadashy/repomix",
  "compress": false,
  "includePatterns": "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md",
  "ignorePatterns": "**/*.log,tmp/",
  "topFilesLength": 10
}
```

### read_repomix_output

Tool ini membaca konten file output yang dihasilkan oleh Repomix. Mendukung pembacaan parsial dengan spesifikasi rentang baris untuk file besar. Tool ini dirancang untuk lingkungan di mana akses filesystem langsung terbatas.

**Parameter:**
- `outputId`: (Wajib) ID file output Repomix untuk dibaca
- `startLine`: (Opsional) Nomor baris awal (berbasis 1, inklusif). Jika tidak ditentukan, membaca dari awal.
- `endLine`: (Opsional) Nomor baris akhir (berbasis 1, inklusif). Jika tidak ditentukan, membaca hingga akhir.

**Fitur:**
- Dirancang khusus untuk lingkungan berbasis web atau aplikasi sandbox
- Mengambil konten output yang dihasilkan sebelumnya menggunakan ID mereka
- Menyediakan akses aman ke codebase yang dikemas tanpa memerlukan akses filesystem
- Mendukung pembacaan parsial untuk file besar

**Contoh:**
```json
{
  "outputId": "8f7d3b1e2a9c6054",
  "startLine": 100,
  "endLine": 200
}
```

### grep_repomix_output

Tool ini mencari pola dalam file output Repomix menggunakan fungsionalitas mirip grep dengan sintaks JavaScript RegExp. Mengembalikan baris yang cocok dengan baris konteks opsional di sekitar kecocokan.

**Parameter:**
- `outputId`: (Wajib) ID file output Repomix untuk dicari
- `pattern`: (Wajib) Pola pencarian (sintaks regular expression JavaScript RegExp)
- `contextLines`: (Opsional, default: 0) Jumlah baris konteks untuk ditampilkan sebelum dan sesudah setiap kecocokan. Diganti oleh beforeLines/afterLines jika ditentukan.
- `beforeLines`: (Opsional) Jumlah baris konteks untuk ditampilkan sebelum setiap kecocokan (seperti grep -B). Mengambil prioritas atas contextLines.
- `afterLines`: (Opsional) Jumlah baris konteks untuk ditampilkan setelah setiap kecocokan (seperti grep -A). Mengambil prioritas atas contextLines.
- `ignoreCase`: (Opsional, default: false) Melakukan pencocokan case-insensitive

**Fitur:**
- Menggunakan sintaks JavaScript RegExp untuk pencocokan pola yang kuat
- Mendukung baris konteks untuk pemahaman kecocokan yang lebih baik
- Memungkinkan kontrol terpisah dari baris konteks sebelum/sesudah
- Opsi pencarian case-sensitive dan case-insensitive

**Contoh:**
```json
{
  "outputId": "8f7d3b1e2a9c6054",
  "pattern": "function\\s+\\w+\\(",
  "contextLines": 3,
  "ignoreCase": false
}
```

### file_system_read_file dan file_system_read_directory

Server MCP Repomix menyediakan dua tools filesystem yang memungkinkan asisten AI untuk berinteraksi dengan aman dengan filesystem lokal:

1. `file_system_read_file`
  - Membaca konten file dari filesystem lokal menggunakan path absolut
  - Termasuk validasi keamanan built-in untuk mendeteksi dan mencegah akses ke file yang berisi informasi sensitif
  - Mengimplementasikan validasi keamanan menggunakan [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint)
  - Mencegah akses ke file yang berisi informasi sensitif (API keys, password, secrets)
  - Memvalidasi path absolut untuk mencegah serangan directory traversal
  - Mengembalikan pesan error yang jelas untuk path yang tidak valid dan masalah keamanan

2. `file_system_read_directory`
  - Mendaftar konten direktori menggunakan path absolut
  - Mengembalikan daftar berformat yang menampilkan file dan subdirektori dengan indikator yang jelas
  - Menampilkan file dan direktori dengan indikator yang jelas (`[FILE]` atau `[DIR]`)
  - Menyediakan navigasi direktori yang aman dengan penanganan error yang tepat
  - Memvalidasi path dan memastikan mereka absolut
  - Berguna untuk mengeksplorasi struktur proyek dan memahami organisasi codebase

Kedua tools menggabungkan tindakan keamanan yang kuat:
- Validasi path absolut untuk mencegah serangan directory traversal
- Pemeriksaan izin untuk memastikan hak akses yang tepat
- Integrasi dengan Secretlint untuk deteksi informasi sensitif
- Pesan error yang jelas untuk debugging dan kesadaran keamanan yang lebih baik

**Contoh:**
```typescript
// Membaca file
const fileContent = await tools.file_system_read_file({
  path: '/absolute/path/to/file.txt'
});

// Mendaftar konten direktori
const dirContent = await tools.file_system_read_directory({
  path: '/absolute/path/to/directory'
});
```

Tools ini sangat berguna ketika asisten AI perlu:
- Menganalisis file spesifik dalam codebase
- Menavigasi struktur direktori
- Memverifikasi eksistensi dan aksesibilitas file
- Memastikan operasi filesystem yang aman

## Manfaat Menggunakan Repomix sebagai Server MCP

Menggunakan Repomix sebagai server MCP menawarkan beberapa keuntungan:

1. **Integrasi Langsung**: Asisten AI dapat menganalisis codebase Anda secara langsung tanpa persiapan file manual.
2. **Workflow Efisien**: Merampingkan proses analisis kode dengan menghilangkan kebutuhan untuk menghasilkan dan mengunggah file secara manual.
3. **Output Konsisten**: Memastikan asisten AI menerima codebase dalam format yang konsisten dan dioptimalkan.
4. **Fitur Lanjutan**: Memanfaatkan semua fitur Repomix seperti kompresi kode, penghitungan token, dan pemeriksaan keamanan.

Setelah dikonfigurasi, asisten AI Anda dapat langsung menggunakan kemampuan Repomix untuk menganalisis codebase, membuat workflow analisis kode lebih efisien.

# Format Output

Repomix mendukung empat format output:
- XML (default)
- Markdown
- JSON
- Plain Text 

## Format XML

```bash
repomix --style xml
```

Format XML dioptimalkan untuk pemrosesan AI:

```xml
Ini adalah representasi gabungan dari seluruh codebase...

<file_summary>

### Mengapa XML sebagai Format Default?

Repomix menggunakan XML sebagai format output default berdasarkan penelitian dan pengujian yang ekstensif. Keputusan ini didasarkan pada bukti empiris dan pertimbangan praktis untuk analisis kode yang dibantu AI.

Pilihan kami terhadap XML terutama dipengaruhi oleh rekomendasi resmi dari penyedia AI utama:
- **Anthropic (Claude)**: Secara eksplisit merekomendasikan penggunaan tag XML untuk menyusun prompt, menyatakan bahwa "Claude terekspos pada prompt semacam itu selama pelatihan" ([dokumentasi](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/use-xml-tags))
- **Google (Gemini)**: Merekomendasikan format terstruktur termasuk XML untuk tugas kompleks ([dokumentasi](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/structure-prompts))
- **OpenAI (GPT)**: Menganjurkan prompting terstruktur dalam skenario kompleks ([pengumuman](https://x.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1890147300493914437), [cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5_prompting_guide))

## Format Markdown

```bash
repomix --style markdown
```

Markdown menyediakan format yang mudah dibaca:

````markdown
Ini adalah representasi gabungan dari seluruh codebase...

# File Summary

## Format JSON

```bash
repomix --style json
```

Format JSON menyediakan output terstruktur yang dapat diakses secara programatis dengan nama properti camelCase:

```json
{
  "fileSummary": {
    "generationHeader": "File ini adalah representasi gabungan dari seluruh codebase, digabungkan menjadi satu dokumen oleh Repomix.",
    "purpose": "File ini berisi representasi terpacked dari keseluruhan konten repositori...",
    "fileFormat": "Konten diorganisir sebagai berikut...",
    "usageGuidelines": "- File ini harus diperlakukan sebagai read-only...",
    "notes": "- Beberapa file mungkin telah dikecualikan berdasarkan aturan .gitignore..."
  },
  "userProvidedHeader": "Teks header kustom jika ditentukan",
  "directoryStructure": "src/
  cli/
    cliOutput.ts
    index.ts
  config/
    configLoader.ts",
  "files": {
    "src/index.js": "// Konten file di sini",
    "src/utils.js": "// Konten file di sini"
  },
  "instruction": "Instruksi kustom dari instructionFilePath"
}
```

### Keuntungan Format JSON

Format JSON ideal untuk:
- **Pemrosesan programatis**: Mudah di-parse dan dimanipulasi dengan library JSON di bahasa pemrograman apa pun
- **Integrasi API**: Konsumsi langsung oleh layanan web dan aplikasi
- **Kompatibilitas tool AI**: Format terstruktur yang dioptimalkan untuk machine learning dan sistem AI
- **Analisis data**: Ekstraksi informasi spesifik yang mudah menggunakan tools seperti `jq`

### Bekerja dengan Output JSON Menggunakan `jq`

Format JSON memudahkan ekstraksi informasi spesifik secara programatis. Berikut adalah contoh umum:

#### Operasi File Dasar
```bash
# Daftar semua path file
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[]'

# Hitung total jumlah file
cat repomix-output.json | jq '.files | keys | length'

# Ekstrak konten file spesifik
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files["README.md"]'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files["src/index.js"]'
```

#### Filtering dan Analisis File
```bash
# Cari file berdasarkan ekstensi
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(endswith(".ts"))'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(endswith(".js") or endswith(".ts"))'

# Dapatkan file yang berisi teks spesifik
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | select(.value | contains("function")) | .key'

# Buat daftar file dengan jumlah karakter
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | "\(.key): \(.value | length) karakter"'
```

#### Ekstraksi Metadata
```bash
# Ekstrak struktur direktori
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.directoryStructure'

# Dapatkan informasi file summary
cat repomix-output.json | jq '.fileSummary.purpose'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.fileSummary.generationHeader'

# Ekstrak header yang disediakan user (jika ada)
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.userProvidedHeader // "Tidak ada header disediakan"'

# Dapatkan instruksi kustom
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.instruction // "Tidak ada instruksi disediakan"'
```

#### Analisis Lanjutan
```bash
# Cari file terbesar berdasarkan panjang konten
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | [.key, (.value | length)] | @tsv' | sort -k2 -nr | head -10

# Cari file yang mengandung pola spesifik
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | select(.value | test("import.*react"; "i")) | .key'

# Ekstrak path file yang cocok dengan beberapa ekstensi
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(test("\.(js|ts|jsx|tsx)$"))'
```

## Format Plain Text

```bash
repomix --style plain
```

Struktur output:
```text
Ini adalah representasi gabungan dari seluruh codebase...

## Penggunaan dengan Model AI

Setiap format bekerja dengan baik dengan model AI, tetapi pertimbangkan:
- Gunakan XML untuk Claude (akurasi parsing terbaik)
- Gunakan Markdown untuk keterbacaan umum
- Gunakan JSON untuk pemrosesan programatis dan integrasi API
- Gunakan Plain Text untuk kesederhanaan dan kompatibilitas universal

## Kustomisasi

Atur format default di `repomix.config.json`:
```json
{
  "output": {
    "style": "xml",
    "filePath": "output.xml"
  }
}
```

# Pemrosesan Repositori GitHub


Repomix dapat memproses repositori GitHub publik secara langsung tanpa perlu mengkloning mereka secara lokal terlebih dahulu. Ini sangat berguna untuk menganalisis proyek open source atau berbagi basis kode dengan AI tanpa mengunduh seluruh repositori.

## Penggunaan Dasar

Untuk memproses repositori remote, gunakan flag `--remote`:

```bash
# Menggunakan format singkat
npx repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix

# Menggunakan URL lengkap
npx repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix
```

## Format yang Didukung

Repomix mendukung beberapa format URL dan referensi:

### Format Singkat

```bash
npx repomix --remote pemilik/repo
```

### URL Lengkap

```bash
npx repomix --remote https://github.com/pemilik/repo
```

### Cabang Tertentu

```bash
npx repomix --remote https://github.com/pemilik/repo/tree/nama-cabang
```

### Commit Tertentu

```bash
npx repomix --remote https://github.com/pemilik/repo/commit/hash-commit
```

### Direktori Tertentu

```bash
npx repomix --remote https://github.com/pemilik/repo/tree/main/path/to/directory
```

## Opsi Tambahan

Anda dapat menggabungkan pemrosesan repositori remote dengan opsi Repomix lainnya:

```bash
# Menggunakan format Markdown
npx repomix --remote pemilik/repo --style markdown

# Menghapus komentar
npx repomix --remote pemilik/repo --remove-comments

# Mengabaikan file tertentu
npx repomix --remote pemilik/repo --ignore "*.log,tmp/"
```

## Batasan

Saat memproses repositori remote, perhatikan batasan berikut:

- Hanya repositori GitHub publik yang didukung
- Ukuran repositori yang sangat besar mungkin memerlukan waktu lebih lama untuk diproses
- Beberapa fitur seperti penghormatan terhadap `.gitignore` mungkin berperilaku berbeda dibandingkan dengan repositori lokal

## Kasus Penggunaan

Pemrosesan repositori remote sangat berguna untuk:

- Menganalisis proyek open source tanpa mengkloning seluruh repositori
- Berbagi basis kode dengan AI untuk mendapatkan wawasan cepat
- Memeriksa bagian tertentu dari repositori besar
- Membandingkan implementasi di berbagai proyek

## File: website/client/src/id/guide/security.md
`````markdown
# Keamanan


Repomix dirancang dengan fokus pada keamanan untuk membantu mencegah kebocoran informasi sensitif saat berbagi basis kode Anda dengan AI.

## Pemeriksaan Keamanan

Secara default, Repomix mengintegrasikan [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint) untuk mendeteksi informasi sensitif dalam basis kode Anda. Ini membantu mencegah kebocoran rahasia seperti kunci API, token, dan kredensial.

Ketika Repomix mendeteksi informasi sensitif, itu akan:

1. Memperingatkan Anda tentang file yang berisi informasi sensitif
2. Mengecualikan file-file tersebut dari output
3. Memberikan detail tentang jenis informasi sensitif yang ditemukan

## Contoh Peringatan Keamanan

```
⚠️ Security check found sensitive information in the following files:
- src/config.js: Contains API key
- .env: Contains multiple secrets

These files have been excluded from the output for security reasons.
```

## Menonaktifkan Pemeriksaan Keamanan

Meskipun tidak disarankan, Anda dapat menonaktifkan pemeriksaan keamanan dengan opsi baris perintah:

```bash
repomix --no-security
```

Atau dalam file konfigurasi:

```json
{
  "security": {
    "enabled": false
  }
}
```

## Aturan Keamanan Kustom

Anda dapat menentukan aturan keamanan kustom dalam file konfigurasi:

```json
{
  "security": {
    "enabled": true,
    "rules": [
      "@secretlint/secretlint-rule-preset-recommend",
      "@secretlint/secretlint-rule-pattern",
      {
        "id": "@secretlint/secretlint-rule-pattern",
        "options": {
          "patterns": [
            {
              "name": "Custom Secret Pattern",
              "pattern": "MY_SECRET_[A-Z0-9]{10}",
              "message": "Found custom secret pattern"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Praktik Terbaik Keamanan

Saat berbagi basis kode dengan AI, ikuti praktik terbaik ini:

1. **Selalu gunakan pemeriksaan keamanan**: Jangan menonaktifkan fitur keamanan Repomix.
2. **Gunakan file .gitignore**: Tambahkan file sensitif ke `.gitignore` Anda.
3. **Gunakan file .env**: Simpan rahasia dalam file `.env` dan tambahkan ke `.gitignore`.
4. **Periksa output**: Selalu periksa file output sebelum membagikannya untuk memastikan tidak ada informasi sensitif.
5. **Gunakan variabel lingkungan**: Gunakan variabel lingkungan untuk rahasia dalam kode Anda.

## Pelaporan Masalah Keamanan

Jika Anda menemukan masalah keamanan di Repomix, harap laporkan secara bertanggung jawab dengan membuka [issue di GitHub](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/issues) atau menghubungi pemelihara secara langsung.

# Penggunaan Dasar


Repomix dirancang untuk menjadi alat yang mudah digunakan dengan antarmuka command-line yang sederhana. Berikut adalah panduan penggunaan dasar.

## Perintah Dasar

Untuk mengemas seluruh repositori Anda:

```bash
repomix
```

Ini akan menghasilkan file `repomix-output.xml` di direktori saat ini, berisi seluruh repositori Anda dalam format yang ramah AI.

## Mengemas Direktori Tertentu

Untuk mengemas direktori tertentu:

```bash
repomix path/to/directory
```

## Menggunakan Pola Glob

Untuk mengemas file atau direktori tertentu menggunakan [pola glob](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax):

```bash
repomix --include "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md"
```

## Mengecualikan File atau Direktori

Untuk mengecualikan file atau direktori tertentu:

```bash
repomix --ignore "**/*.log,tmp/"
```

## Mengemas Repositori Jarak Jauh

Repomix dapat mengemas repositori GitHub publik:

```bash
# Menggunakan format singkat
npx repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix

# Menggunakan URL lengkap (mendukung cabang dan jalur tertentu)
npx repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix
npx repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/tree/main

# Menggunakan URL commit
npx repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/commit/836...
```

## Input Daftar File (stdin)

Masukkan jalur file melalui stdin untuk fleksibilitas maksimum:

```bash
# Menggunakan perintah find
find src -name "*.ts" -type f | repomix --stdin

# Menggunakan git untuk mendapatkan file yang terlacak
git ls-files "*.ts" | repomix --stdin

# Menggunakan grep untuk mencari file yang berisi konten tertentu
grep -l "TODO" **/*.ts | repomix --stdin

# Menggunakan ripgrep untuk mencari file dengan konten tertentu
rg -l "TODO|FIXME" --type ts | repomix --stdin

# Menggunakan ripgrep (rg) untuk mencari file
rg --files --type ts | repomix --stdin

# Menggunakan sharkdp/fd untuk mencari file
fd -e ts | repomix --stdin

# Menggunakan fzf untuk memilih dari semua file
fzf -m | repomix --stdin

# Pemilihan file interaktif dengan fzf
find . -name "*.ts" -type f | fzf -m | repomix --stdin

# Menggunakan ls dengan pola glob
ls src/**/*.ts | repomix --stdin

# Dari file yang berisi jalur file
cat file-list.txt | repomix --stdin

# Input langsung dengan echo
echo -e "src/index.ts\nsrc/utils.ts" | repomix --stdin
```

Opsi `--stdin` memungkinkan Anda untuk mem-pipe daftar jalur file ke Repomix, memberikan fleksibilitas maksimum dalam memilih file mana yang akan dikemas.

Saat menggunakan `--stdin`, file yang ditentukan secara efektif ditambahkan ke pola include. Ini berarti perilaku include dan ignore normal masih berlaku - file yang ditentukan melalui stdin masih akan dikecualikan jika cocok dengan pola ignore.

> [!NOTE]
> Saat menggunakan `--stdin`, jalur file dapat berupa jalur relatif atau absolut, dan Repomix akan menangani resolusi jalur dan deduplikasi secara otomatis.

### Kompresi Kode

```bash
repomix --compress

# Anda juga dapat menggunakannya dengan repositori jarak jauh:
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix --compress
```

### Integrasi Git

Sertakan informasi Git untuk memberikan konteks pengembangan bagi analisis AI:

```bash
# Sertakan diff git (perubahan yang belum di-commit)
repomix --include-diffs

# Sertakan log commit git (50 commit terakhir secara default)
repomix --include-logs

# Sertakan jumlah commit tertentu
repomix --include-logs --include-logs-count 10

# Sertakan diff dan log
repomix --include-diffs --include-logs
```

Ini menambahkan konteks berharga tentang:
- **Perubahan terbaru**: Diff Git menunjukkan modifikasi yang belum di-commit
- **Pola pengembangan**: Log Git mengungkapkan file mana yang biasanya diubah bersamaan
- **Riwayat commit**: Pesan commit terbaru memberikan wawasan tentang fokus pengembangan
- **Hubungan file**: Memahami file mana yang dimodifikasi dalam commit yang sama

### Optimisasi Jumlah Token

Memahami distribusi token dari basis kode Anda sangat penting untuk mengoptimalkan interaksi AI. Gunakan opsi `--token-count-tree` untuk memvisualisasikan penggunaan token di seluruh proyek Anda:

```bash
repomix --token-count-tree
```

Ini menampilkan tampilan hierarkis dari basis kode Anda dengan jumlah token:

```
🔢 Token Count Tree:
────────────────────
└── src/ (70,925 tokens)
    ├── cli/ (12,714 tokens)
    │   ├── actions/ (7,546 tokens)
    │   └── reporters/ (990 tokens)
    └── core/ (41,600 tokens)
        ├── file/ (10,098 tokens)
        └── output/ (5,808 tokens)
```

Anda juga dapat menetapkan ambang batas minimum token untuk fokus pada file yang lebih besar:

```bash
repomix --token-count-tree 1000  # Hanya tampilkan file/direktori dengan 1000+ token
```

Ini membantu Anda:
- **Mengidentifikasi file yang berat token** - yang mungkin melebihi batas konteks AI
- **Mengoptimalkan pemilihan file** - menggunakan pola `--include` dan `--ignore`
- **Merencanakan strategi kompresi** - menargetkan kontributor terbesar
- **Menyeimbangkan konten vs konteks** - saat mempersiapkan kode untuk analisis AI

## File: website/client/src/it/guide/development/using-repomix-as-a-library.md
`````markdown
# Usare Repomix come Libreria

Oltre a usare Repomix come strumento CLI, puoi integrare le sue funzionalità direttamente nelle tue applicazioni Node.js.

## Installazione

Installa Repomix come dipendenza nel tuo progetto:

```bash
npm install repomix
```

## Utilizzo Base

Il modo più semplice per usare Repomix è tramite la funzione `runCli`, che fornisce le stesse funzionalità dell'interfaccia a linea di comando:

```javascript
import { runCli, type CliOptions } from 'repomix';

// Elabora la directory corrente con opzioni personalizzate
async function packProject() {
  const options = {
    output: 'output.xml',
    style: 'xml',
    compress: true,
    quiet: true
  } as CliOptions;

  const result = await runCli(['.'], process.cwd(), options);
  return result.packResult;
}
```

Il `result.packResult` contiene informazioni sui file elaborati, inclusi:
- `totalFiles`: Numero di file elaborati
- `totalCharacters`: Numero totale di caratteri
- `totalTokens`: Numero totale di token (utile per i limiti di contesto degli LLM)
- `fileCharCounts`: Conteggio caratteri per file
- `fileTokenCounts`: Conteggio token per file

## Elaborazione di Repository Remoti

Puoi clonare ed elaborare un repository remoto:

```javascript
import { runCli, type CliOptions } from 'repomix';

// Clona ed elabora un repository GitHub
async function processRemoteRepo(repoUrl) {
  const options = {
    remote: repoUrl,
    output: 'output.xml',
    compress: true
  } as CliOptions;

  return await runCli(['.'], process.cwd(), options);
}
```

## Uso dei Componenti Core

Per un controllo più preciso, puoi usare direttamente le API di basso livello di Repomix:

```javascript
import { searchFiles, collectFiles, processFiles, TokenCounter } from 'repomix';

async function analyzeFiles(directory) {
  // Cerca e raccogli i file
  const { filePaths } = await searchFiles(directory, { /* configurazione */ });
  const rawFiles = await collectFiles(filePaths, directory);
  const processedFiles = await processFiles(rawFiles, { /* configurazione */ });

  // Conta i token
  const tokenCounter = new TokenCounter('o200k_base');

  // Restituisci i risultati dell'analisi
  return processedFiles.map(file => ({
    path: file.path,
    tokens: tokenCounter.countTokens(file.content)
  }));
}
```

## Esempio Reale

Il sito web di Repomix ([repomix.com](https://repomix.com)) usa Repomix come libreria per elaborare repository remoti. Puoi consultare l'implementazione in [website/server/src/remoteRepo.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/....ts).

# Best Practice per lo Sviluppo Assistito da IA: Dalla Mia Esperienza

Anche se non ho ancora portato a termine con successo un progetto su larga scala usando l'IA, voglio condividere ciò che ho imparato finora dalla mia esperienza di lavoro con l'IA nello sviluppo.

## Approccio Base allo Sviluppo

Quando si lavora con l'IA, tentare di implementare tutte le funzionalità in una volta può portare a problemi imprevisti e stagnazione del progetto. Ecco perché è più efficace iniziare con le funzionalità principali e costruire ogni funzionalità una alla volta, assicurandosi di un'implementazione solida prima di andare avanti.

### Il Potere del Codice Esistente

Questo approccio è efficace perché l'implementazione delle funzionalità principali ti permette di materializzare il tuo design ideale e il tuo stile di codifica attraverso codice reale. Il modo più efficace per comunicare la tua visione del progetto è attraverso codice che riflette i tuoi standard e preferenze.

Iniziando con le funzionalità principali e assicurandosi che ogni componente funzioni correttamente prima di passare al successivo, l'intero progetto mantiene la sua coerenza, rendendo più facile per l'IA generare codice più appropriato.

## L'Approccio Modulare

Scomporre il codice in moduli più piccoli è cruciale. Dalla mia esperienza, mantenere i file intorno alle 250 righe di codice rende più facile dare istruzioni chiare all'IA e rende il processo di tentativi ed errori più efficiente. Anche se il conteggio dei token sarebbe una metrica più precisa, il conteggio delle righe è più pratico per gli sviluppatori umani, quindi lo usiamo come linea guida.

Questa modularizzazione non riguarda solo la separazione dei componenti frontend, backend e database—si tratta di scomporre le funzionalità a un livello molto più fine. Per esempio, all'interno della stessa funzionalità, potresti separare la validazione, la gestione degli errori e altre funzionalità specifiche in moduli distinti. Naturalmente, anche la separazione di alto livello è importante, e implementare questo approccio modulare gradualmente aiuta a mantenere istruzioni chiare e permette all'IA di generare codice più appropriato. Questo approccio è efficace non solo per l'IA ma anche per gli sviluppatori umani.

## Garantire la Qualità attraverso i Test

Considero i test cruciali nello sviluppo assistito da IA. I test servono non solo come misure di garanzia della qualità ma anche come documentazione che dimostra chiaramente le intenzioni del codice. Quando chiedi all'IA di implementare nuove funzionalità, il codice di test esistente agisce efficacemente come un documento di specifica.

I test sono anche un ottimo strumento per validare la correttezza del codice generato dall'IA. Per esempio, quando fai implementare una nuova funzionalità per un modulo all'IA, scrivere i casi di test in anticipo ti permette di valutare oggettivamente se il codice generato si comporta come previsto. Questo si allinea bene con i principi del Test-Driven Development (TDD) ed è particolarmente efficace quando si collabora con l'IA.

## Bilanciare Pianificazione e Implementazione

Prima di implementare funzionalità su larga scala, raccomando di discutere prima il piano con l'IA. Organizzare i requisiti e riflettere sull'architettura porta a un'implementazione più fluida. Una buona pratica è compilare prima i requisiti, poi passare a una sessione di chat separata per il lavoro di implementazione.

È essenziale che gli umani rivedano l'output dell'IA e facciano aggiustamenti se necessario. Anche se la qualità del codice generato dall'IA è generalmente moderata, questo comunque accelera lo sviluppo rispetto a scrivere tutto da zero.

## Conclusione

Seguendo queste pratiche, puoi sfruttare i punti di forza dell'IA mentre costruisci una codebase coerente e di alta qualità. Anche quando il tuo progetto cresce in dimensioni, ogni componente rimane ben definito e gestibile.

# Generazione Agent Skills

Repomix può generare output nel formato [Claude Agent Skills](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills), creando una directory strutturata di Skills che può essere usata come riferimento di codebase riutilizzabile per gli assistenti IA.

Questa funzionalità è particolarmente potente quando vuoi fare riferimento a implementazioni di repository remoti. Generando Skills da progetti open source, puoi facilmente chiedere a Claude di fare riferimento a pattern o implementazioni specifiche mentre lavori sul tuo codice.

Invece di generare un singolo file impacchettato, la generazione di Skills crea una directory strutturata con più file di riferimento ottimizzati per la comprensione dell'IA e la ricerca compatibile con grep.

> [!NOTE]
> Questa è una funzionalità sperimentale. Il formato di output e le opzioni potrebbero cambiare nelle versioni future in base ai feedback degli utenti.

## Utilizzo Base

Genera Skills dalla tua directory locale:

```bash
# Genera Skills dalla directory corrente
repomix --skill-generate

# Genera con un nome Skills personalizzato
repomix --skill-generate my-project-reference

# Genera da una directory specifica
repomix path/to/directory --skill-generate

# Genera da un repository remoto
repomix --remote https://github.com/user/repo --skill-generate
```

## Selezione della Posizione degli Skills

Quando esegui il comando, Repomix ti chiede di scegliere dove salvare gli Skills:

1. **Personal Skills** (`~/.claude/skills/`) - Disponibile per tutti i progetti sulla tua macchina
2. **Project Skills** (`.claude/skills/`) - Condiviso con il tuo team tramite git

Se la directory Skills esiste già, ti verrà chiesto di confermare la sovrascrittura.

> [!TIP]
> Quando generi Project Skills, considera di aggiungerli a `.gitignore` per evitare di committare file grandi:
> ```gitignore
> .claude/skills/repomix-reference-*/
> ```

## Struttura Generata

Gli Skills vengono generati con la seguente struttura:

```text
.claude/skills/<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md                    # Metadati principali e documentazione Skills
└── references/
    ├── summary.md              # Scopo, formato e statistiche
    ├── project-structure.md    # Albero con conteggio righe
    ├── files.md                # Tutto il contenuto dei file (compatibile grep)
    └── tech-stack.md           # Linguaggi, framework, dipendenze
```

### Descrizioni dei File

#### SKILL.md

Il file principale degli Skills contiene:
- Nome Skills, descrizione e informazioni del progetto
- Conteggio file, righe e token
- Panoramica dell'utilizzo degli Skills
- Posizioni dei file e spiegazione del formato
- Casi d'uso comuni e suggerimenti

#### references/summary.md

Contiene:
- **Scopo**: Spiega che questa è una codebase di riferimento per uso IA
- **Struttura File**: Documenta il contenuto di ogni file di riferimento
- **Linee Guida d'Uso**: Come usare efficacemente gli Skills
- **Statistiche**: Ripartizione per tipo di file, linguaggio e file più grandi

#### references/project-structure.md

Albero con conteggio righe per file per una facile scoperta:

```text
src/
  index.ts (42 lines)
  utils/
    helpers.ts (128 lines)
    math.ts (87 lines)
```

#### references/files.md

Tutto il contenuto dei file con intestazioni di syntax highlighting, ottimizzato per la ricerca compatibile grep:

````markdown
## File: src/index.ts
```typescript
import { sum } from './utils/helpers';

export function main() {
  console.log(sum(1, 2));
}
```
````

#### references/tech-stack.md

Stack tecnologico auto-rilevato dai file delle dipendenze:
- **Linguaggi**: TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, ecc.
- **Framework**: React, Next.js, Express, Django, ecc.
- **Versioni Runtime**: Node.js, Python, Go, ecc.
- **Package Manager**: npm, pnpm, poetry, ecc.
- **Dipendenze**: Tutte le dipendenze dirette e di sviluppo
- **File di Configurazione**: Tutti i file di configurazione rilevati

Rilevato da file come: `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `.nvmrc`, `pyproject.toml`, ecc.

## Nomi Skills Auto-Generati

Se non viene fornito un nome, Repomix ne genera automaticamente uno con questo pattern:

```bash
repomix src/ --skill-generate                # → repomix-reference-src
repomix --remote user/repo --skill-generate  # → repomix-reference-repo
repomix --skill-generate CustomName          # → custom-name (normalizzato in kebab-case)
```

I nomi degli Skills sono:
- Convertiti in kebab-case (minuscole, separati da trattini)
- Limitati a massimo 64 caratteri
- Protetti contro path traversal

## Integrazione con le Opzioni Repomix

La generazione di Skills rispetta tutte le opzioni standard di Repomix:

```bash
# Genera Skills con filtraggio file
repomix --skill-generate --include "src/**/*.ts" --ignore "**/*.test.ts"

# Genera Skills con compressione
repomix --skill-generate --compress

# Genera Skills da un repository remoto
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix --skill-generate

# Genera Skills con opzioni specifiche di formato output
repomix --skill-generate --remove-comments --remove-empty-lines
```

### Skills Solo Documentazione

Usando `--include`, puoi generare Skills contenenti solo la documentazione di un repository GitHub. È utile quando vuoi che Claude faccia riferimento a documentazione specifica di librerie o framework mentre lavori sul tuo codice:

```bash
# Documentazione Claude Code Action
repomix --remote https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action --include docs --skill-generate

# Documentazione Vite
repomix --remote https://github.com/vitejs/vite --include docs --skill-generate

# Documentazione React
repomix --remote https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev --include src/content --skill-generate
```

## Limitazioni

L'opzione `--skill-generate` non può essere usata con:
- `--stdout` - L'output Skills richiede scrittura sul file system
- `--copy` - L'output Skills è una directory, non copiabile negli appunti

## Uso degli Skills Generati

Una volta generati, puoi usare gli Skills con Claude:

1. **Claude Code**: Gli Skills sono automaticamente disponibili se salvati in `~/.claude/skills/` o `.claude/skills/`
2. **Claude Web**: Carica la directory Skills su Claude per l'analisi della codebase
3. **Condivisione Team**: Committa `.claude/skills/` nel tuo repository per l'accesso di tutto il team

## Workflow di Esempio

### Creare una Libreria di Riferimento Personale

```bash
# Clona e analizza un progetto open source interessante
repomix --remote facebook/react --skill-generate react-reference

# Gli Skills sono salvati in ~/.claude/skills/react-reference/
# Ora puoi fare riferimento alla codebase di React in qualsiasi conversazione Claude
```

### Documentazione del Progetto Team

```bash
# Nella directory del tuo progetto
cd my-project

# Genera Skills per il tuo team
repomix --skill-generate

# Scegli "Project Skills" quando richiesto
# Gli Skills sono salvati in .claude/skills/repomix-reference-my-project/

# Committa e condividi con il tuo team
git add .claude/skills/
git commit -m "Add codebase reference Skills"
```

## File: website/client/src/it/guide/code-compress.md
`````markdown
# Compressione Codice

La compressione del codice è una funzionalità potente che estrae intelligentemente le strutture di codice essenziali mentre rimuove i dettagli di implementazione. È particolarmente utile per ridurre il conteggio dei token mantenendo le informazioni strutturali importanti della tua codebase.

> [!NOTE]
> Questa è una funzionalità sperimentale che miglioreremo attivamente in base ai feedback degli utenti e all'uso reale

## Utilizzo Base

Abilita la compressione del codice usando l'opzione `--compress`:

```bash
repomix --compress
```

Puoi anche usarla con repository remoti:

```bash
repomix --remote user/repo --compress
```

## Come Funziona

L'algoritmo di compressione elabora il codice usando l'analisi tree-sitter per estrarre e preservare gli elementi strutturali essenziali mentre rimuove i dettagli di implementazione.

La compressione preserva:
- Firme di funzioni e metodi
- Definizioni di interfacce e tipi
- Strutture di classi e le loro proprietà
- Elementi strutturali importanti

Mentre rimuove:
- Implementazioni di funzioni e metodi
- Dettagli di logica di cicli e condizioni
- Dichiarazioni di variabili interne
- Codice specifico dell'implementazione

### Esempio

Codice TypeScript originale:

```typescript
import { ShoppingItem } from './shopping-item';
/**
 * Calculate the total price of shopping items
 */
const calculateTotal = (
  items: ShoppingItem[]
) => {
  let total = 0;
  for (const item of items) {
    total += item.price * item.quantity;
  }
  return total;
}
// Shopping item interface
interface Item {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  quantity: number;
}
```

Dopo la compressione:

```typescript
import { ShoppingItem } from './shopping-item';
⋮----
/**
 * Calculate the total price of shopping items
 */
const calculateTotal = (
  items: ShoppingItem[]
) => {
⋮----
// Shopping item interface
interface Item {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  quantity: number;
}
```

## Configurazione

Puoi abilitare la compressione nel tuo file di configurazione:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "compress": true
  }
}
```

## Casi d'Uso

La compressione del codice è particolarmente utile per:
- Analizzare la struttura e l'architettura del codice
- Ridurre il conteggio dei token per l'elaborazione da parte degli LLM
- Creare documentazione di alto livello
- Comprendere pattern di codice e firme
- Condividere design di API e interfacce

## Opzioni Correlate

Puoi combinare la compressione con altre opzioni:
- `--remove-comments`: Rimuove i commenti dal codice
- `--remove-empty-lines`: Rimuove le righe vuote
- `--output-show-line-numbers`: Aggiunge numeri di riga all'output

## File: website/client/src/it/guide/comment-removal.md
`````markdown
# Rimozione Commenti

Repomix può rimuovere automaticamente i commenti dalla tua codebase durante la generazione del file di output. Questo può aiutare a ridurre il rumore e concentrarsi sul codice vero e proprio.

## Utilizzo

Per abilitare la rimozione dei commenti, imposta l'opzione `removeComments` su `true` nel tuo `repomix.config.json`:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "removeComments": true
  }
}
```

## Linguaggi Supportati

Repomix supporta la rimozione dei commenti per un'ampia gamma di linguaggi di programmazione, tra cui:

- JavaScript/TypeScript (`//`, `/* */`)
- Python (`#`, `"""`, `'''`)
- Java (`//`, `/* */`)
- C/C++ (`//`, `/* */`)
- HTML (`<!-- -->`)
- CSS (`/* */`)
- E molti altri...

## Esempio

Considera il seguente codice JavaScript:

```javascript
// Questo è un commento su una riga
function test() {
  /* Questo è un
     commento su
     più righe */
  return true;
}
```

Con la rimozione dei commenti abilitata, l'output sarà:

```javascript
function test() {
  return true;
}
```

## Note

- La rimozione dei commenti viene eseguita prima di altre fasi di elaborazione, come l'aggiunta dei numeri di riga.
- Alcuni commenti, come i commenti JSDoc, potrebbero essere preservati a seconda del linguaggio e del contesto.

`````markdown
# Configurazione

Repomix può essere configurato usando un file di configurazione o opzioni da linea di comando. Il file di configurazione ti permette di personalizzare vari aspetti dell'elaborazione e dell'output della tua codebase.

## Formati dei File di Configurazione

Repomix supporta diversi formati di file di configurazione per maggiore flessibilità e facilità d'uso.

Repomix cercherà automaticamente i file di configurazione nel seguente ordine di priorità:

1. **TypeScript** (`repomix.config.ts`, `repomix.config.mts`, `repomix.config.cts`)
2. **JavaScript/ES Module** (`repomix.config.js`, `repomix.config.mjs`, `repomix.config.cjs`)
3. **JSON** (`repomix.config.json5`, `repomix.config.jsonc`, `repomix.config.json`)

### Configurazione JSON

Crea un file di configurazione nella directory del tuo progetto:
```bash
repomix --init
```

Questo creerà un file `repomix.config.json` con le impostazioni predefinite. Puoi anche creare un file di configurazione globale che verrà usato come fallback quando non viene trovata una configurazione locale:

```bash
repomix --init --global
```

### Configurazione TypeScript

I file di configurazione TypeScript offrono la migliore esperienza di sviluppo con verifica completa dei tipi e supporto IDE.

**Installazione:**

Per usare la configurazione TypeScript o JavaScript con `defineConfig`, devi installare Repomix come dipendenza di sviluppo:

```bash
npm install -D repomix
```

**Esempio:**

```typescript
// repomix.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'repomix';

export default defineConfig({
  output: {
    filePath: 'output.xml',
    style: 'xml',
    removeComments: true,
  },
  ignore: {
    customPatterns: ['**/node_modules/**', '**/dist/**'],
  },
});
```

**Vantaggi:**
- ✅ Verifica completa dei tipi TypeScript nel tuo IDE
- ✅ Eccellente autocompletamento e IntelliSense
- ✅ Utilizzo di valori dinamici (timestamp, variabili d'ambiente, ecc.)

**Esempio di Valori Dinamici:**

```typescript
// repomix.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'repomix';

// Genera un nome file basato sul timestamp
const timestamp = new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 19).replace(/[:.]/g, '-');

export default defineConfig({
  output: {
    filePath: `output-${timestamp}.xml`,
    style: 'xml',
  },
});
```

### Configurazione JavaScript

I file di configurazione JavaScript funzionano allo stesso modo di TypeScript, supportando `defineConfig` e valori dinamici.

## Opzioni di Configurazione

| `tokenCount.encoding`            | Encoding del conteggio token usato dal tokenizer [tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) di OpenAI. Usa `o200k_base` per GPT-4o, `cl100k_base` per GPT-4/3.5. Vedi [tiktoken model.py](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken/blob/main/tiktoken/model.py#L24) per dettagli. | `"o200k_base"`         |

Il file di configurazione supporta la sintassi [JSON5](https://json5.org/), che permette:
- Commenti (sia su singola riga che su più righe)
- Virgole finali in oggetti e array
- Nomi di proprietà non tra virgolette
- Sintassi stringa più flessibile

## Validazione Schema

Puoi abilitare la validazione schema per il tuo file di configurazione aggiungendo la proprietà `$schema`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://repomix.com/schemas/latest/schema.json",
  "output": {
    "filePath": "repomix-output.md",
    "style": "markdown"
  }
}
```

Questo fornisce autocompletamento e validazione negli editor che supportano gli schema JSON.

## Esempio di File di Configurazione

Ecco un esempio completo di file di configurazione (`repomix.config.json`):

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://repomix.com/schemas/latest/schema.json",
  "input": {
    "maxFileSize": 50000000
  },
  "output": {
    "filePath": "repomix-output.xml",
    "style": "xml",
    "parsableStyle": false,
    "compress": false,
    "headerText": "Informazioni di intestazione personalizzate per il file compresso.",
    "fileSummary": true,
    "directoryStructure": true,
    "files": true,
    "removeComments": false,
    "removeEmptyLines": false,
    "topFilesLength": 5,

    }
  },
  "include": ["**/*"],

    ],
  },
  "security": {
    "enableSecurityCheck": true
  },
  "tokenCount": {
    "encoding": "o200k_base"
  }
}
```

## Posizioni dei File di Configurazione

Repomix cerca i file di configurazione nel seguente ordine:
1. File di configurazione locale nella directory corrente (ordine di priorità: TS > JS > JSON)
   - TypeScript: `repomix.config.ts`, `repomix.config.mts`, `repomix.config.cts`
   - JavaScript: `repomix.config.js`, `repomix.config.mjs`, `repomix.config.cjs`
   - JSON: `repomix.config.json5`, `repomix.config.jsonc`, `repomix.config.json`
2. File di configurazione globale (ordine di priorità: TS > JS > JSON)
   - Windows:
     - TypeScript: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.ts`, `.mts`, `.cts`
     - JavaScript: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`
     - JSON: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.json5`, `.jsonc`, `.json`
   - macOS/Linux:
     - TypeScript: `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.ts`, `.mts`, `.cts`
     - JavaScript: `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`
     - JSON: `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.json5`, `.jsonc`, `.json`

Le opzioni da linea di comando hanno la priorità sulle impostazioni del file di configurazione.

## Pattern di Inclusione

Repomix supporta la specifica dei file da includere usando [pattern glob](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax). Questo permette una selezione di file più flessibile e potente:

- Usa `**/*.js` per includere tutti i file JavaScript in qualsiasi directory
- Usa `src/**/*` per includere tutti i file nella directory `src` e le sue sottodirectory
- Combina più pattern come `["src/**/*.js", "**/*.md"]` per includere i file JavaScript in `src` e tutti i file Markdown

Puoi specificare pattern di inclusione nel tuo file di configurazione:

```json
{
  "include": ["src/**/*", "tests/**/*.test.js"]
}
```

Oppure usa l'opzione da linea di comando `--include` per filtraggio una tantum.

## Pattern di Esclusione

Repomix offre diversi metodi per definire pattern di esclusione per escludere file o directory specifici durante il processo di impacchettamento:

- **.gitignore**: Per impostazione predefinita, i pattern elencati nei file `.gitignore` del progetto e `.git/info/exclude` sono usati. Questo comportamento può essere controllato con l'impostazione `ignore.useGitignore` o l'opzione CLI `--no-gitignore`.
- **.ignore**: Puoi usare un file `.ignore` alla radice del progetto, seguendo lo stesso formato di `.gitignore`. Questo file è rispettato da strumenti come ripgrep e the silver searcher, riducendo la necessità di mantenere più file di esclusione. Questo comportamento può essere controllato con l'impostazione `ignore.useDotIgnore` o l'opzione CLI `--no-dot-ignore`.
- **Pattern predefiniti**: Repomix include una lista predefinita di file e directory comunemente esclusi (es. node_modules, .git, file binari). Questa funzionalità può essere controllata con l'impostazione `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` o l'opzione CLI `--no-default-patterns`. Consulta [defaultIgnore.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/src/config/defaultIgnore.ts) per dettagli.
- **.repomixignore**: Puoi creare un file `.repomixignore` alla radice del progetto per definire pattern di esclusione specifici per Repomix. Questo file segue lo stesso formato di `.gitignore`.
- **Pattern personalizzati**: Pattern di esclusione aggiuntivi possono essere specificati usando l'opzione `ignore.customPatterns` nel file di configurazione. Puoi sovrascrivere questa impostazione con l'opzione da linea di comando `-i, --ignore`.

**Ordine di priorità** (dal più alto al più basso):

1. Pattern personalizzati (`ignore.customPatterns`)
2. File di esclusione (`.repomixignore`, `.ignore`, `.gitignore`, e `.git/info/exclude`):
   - Quando sono in directory annidate, i file nelle directory più profonde hanno priorità maggiore
   - Quando sono nella stessa directory, questi file sono uniti senza ordine particolare
3. Pattern predefiniti (se `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` è true e `--no-default-patterns` non è usato)

Questo approccio permette una configurazione flessibile dell'esclusione dei file in base alle esigenze del progetto. Aiuta a ottimizzare la dimensione del file impacchettato generato garantendo l'esclusione di file sensibili alla sicurezza e grandi file binari, mentre previene la fuga di informazioni confidenziali.

**Nota:** I file binari non sono inclusi nell'output impacchettato per impostazione predefinita, ma i loro percorsi sono elencati nella sezione "Struttura del Repository" del file di output. Questo fornisce una panoramica completa della struttura del repository mantenendo il file impacchettato efficiente e basato su testo. Vedi [Gestione File Binari](#gestione-file-binari) per dettagli.

Esempio di `.repomixignore`:
```text
# Directory di cache
.cache/
tmp/

# Output di build
dist/
build/

# Log
*.log
```

## Pattern di Esclusione Predefiniti

Quando `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` è true, Repomix ignora automaticamente i pattern comuni:
```text
node_modules/**
.git/**
coverage/**
dist/**
```

Per la lista completa, vedi [defaultIgnore.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/src/config/defaultIgnore.ts)

## Gestione File Binari

I file binari (come immagini, PDF, binari compilati, archivi, ecc.) sono trattati in modo speciale per mantenere un output efficiente basato su testo:

- **Contenuti dei file**: I file binari **non sono inclusi** nell'output impacchettato per mantenere il file basato su testo ed efficiente per l'elaborazione IA
- **Struttura delle directory**: I percorsi dei file binari **sono elencati** nella sezione struttura directory, fornendo una panoramica completa del repository

Questo approccio garantisce che ottieni una vista completa della struttura del repository mantenendo un output efficiente basato su testo ottimizzato per il consumo dell'IA.

**Esempio:**

Se il tuo repository contiene `logo.png` e `app.jar`:
- Appariranno nella sezione Struttura Directory
- I loro contenuti non saranno inclusi nella sezione File

**Output struttura directory:**
```
src/
  index.ts
  utils.ts
assets/
  logo.png
build/
  app.jar
```

In questo modo, gli strumenti IA possono capire che questi file binari esistono nella struttura del progetto senza elaborare i loro contenuti binari.

**Nota:** Puoi controllare la soglia massima della dimensione dei file usando l'opzione di configurazione `input.maxFileSize` (predefinito: 50MB). I file più grandi di questo limite saranno completamente ignorati.

## Funzionalità Avanzate

### Compressione del Codice

La funzionalità di compressione del codice, abilitata con `output.compress: true`, usa [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) per estrarre intelligentemente le strutture di codice essenziali mentre rimuove i dettagli di implementazione. Questo aiuta a ridurre il conteggio token mantenendo le informazioni strutturali importanti.

Vantaggi principali:
- Riduce significativamente il conteggio token
- Preserva le firme di classi e funzioni
- Mantiene import ed export
- Conserva le definizioni di tipi e le interfacce
- Rimuove i corpi delle funzioni e i dettagli di implementazione

Per dettagli ed esempi, consulta la [Guida alla Compressione del Codice](code-compress).

### Integrazione Git

La configurazione `output.git` fornisce potenti funzionalità relative a Git:

- `sortByChanges`: Quando true, i file sono ordinati per numero di modifiche Git (commit che hanno modificato il file). I file con più modifiche appaiono in fondo all'output. Questo aiuta a dare priorità ai file più attivamente sviluppati. Predefinito: `true`
- `sortByChangesMaxCommits`: Il numero massimo di commit da analizzare quando si contano le modifiche ai file. Predefinito: `100`
- `includeDiffs`: Quando true, include i diff Git nell'output (include separatamente le modifiche dell'albero di lavoro e le modifiche staged). Questo permette al lettore di vedere le modifiche in sospeso nel repository. Predefinito: `false`
- `includeLogs`: Quando true, include la cronologia dei commit Git nell'output. Mostra le date dei commit, i messaggi e i percorsi dei file per ogni commit. Questo aiuta l'IA a comprendere i pattern di sviluppo e le relazioni tra file. Predefinito: `false`
- `includeLogsCount`: Il numero di commit recenti da includere nei log git. Predefinito: `50`

Esempio di configurazione:
```json
{
  "output": {
    "git": {
      "sortByChanges": true,
      "sortByChangesMaxCommits": 100,
      "includeDiffs": true,
      "includeLogs": true,
      "includeLogsCount": 25
    }
  }
}
```

### Controlli di Sicurezza

Quando `security.enableSecurityCheck` è abilitato, Repomix usa [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint) per rilevare informazioni sensibili nella tua codebase prima di includerle nell'output. Questo aiuta a prevenire l'esposizione accidentale di:

- Chiavi API
- Token di accesso
- Chiavi private
- Password
- Altre credenziali sensibili

### Rimozione Commenti

Quando `output.removeComments` è impostato a `true`, i commenti sono rimossi dai tipi di file supportati per ridurre la dimensione dell'output e concentrarsi sul contenuto essenziale del codice. Questo può essere particolarmente utile quando:

- Lavori con codice fortemente documentato
- Cerchi di ridurre il conteggio token
- Ti concentri sulla struttura e la logica del codice

Per i linguaggi supportati e esempi dettagliati, consulta la [Guida alla Rimozione Commenti](comment-removal).

## File: website/client/src/it/guide/custom-instructions.md
`````markdown
# Istruzioni Personalizzate

Repomix ti permette di fornire istruzioni personalizzate che saranno incluse nel file di output. Questo può essere utile per aggiungere contesto o direttive specifiche per i sistemi IA che elaborano il repository.

## Utilizzo

Per includere un'istruzione personalizzata, crea un file markdown (es. `repomix-instruction.md`) alla radice del tuo repository. Poi, specifica il percorso di questo file nel tuo `repomix.config.json`:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "instructionFilePath": "repomix-instruction.md"
  }
}
```

Il contenuto di questo file sarà incluso nell'output sotto la sezione "Instruction".

## Esempio

```markdown
# Istruzioni del Repository
Questo repository contiene il codice sorgente dello strumento Repomix. Per favore segui queste direttive durante l'analisi del codice:
1. Concentrati sulle funzionalità principali nella directory `src/core`.
2. Presta particolare attenzione ai controlli di sicurezza in `src/core/security`.
3. Ignora tutti i file nella directory `tests`.
```

Questo produrrà la seguente sezione nell'output:

```xml
<instruction>
# Istruzioni del Repository
Questo repository contiene il codice sorgente dello strumento Repomix. Per favore segui queste direttive durante l'analisi del codice:
1. Concentrati sulle funzionalità principali nella directory `src/core`.
2. Presta particolare attenzione ai controlli di sicurezza in `src/core/security`.
3. Ignora tutti i file nella directory `tests`.
</instruction>
```
`````

# Usare Repomix con GitHub Actions

Puoi automatizzare l'impacchettamento della tua codebase per l'analisi IA integrando Repomix nei tuoi workflow GitHub Actions. Questo è utile per l'integrazione continua (CI), la revisione del codice o la preparazione per strumenti LLM.

## Utilizzo Base

Aggiungi il seguente step al tuo file YAML del workflow per impacchettare il tuo repository:

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    output: repomix-output.xml
```

## Usare Diversi Formati di Output

Puoi specificare diversi formati di output usando il parametro `style` (il formato predefinito è `xml`):

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    output: repomix-output.md
    style: markdown
```

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix (JSON format)
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    output: repomix-output.json
    style: json
```

## Impacchettare Più Cartelle con Compressione

Puoi specificare più cartelle, pattern di inclusione/esclusione e abilitare la compressione intelligente:

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    directories: src tests
    include: "**/*.ts,**/*.md"
    ignore: "**/*.test.ts"
    output: repomix-output.txt
    compress: true
```

## Caricare il File Generato come Artifact

Per rendere il file impacchettato disponibile per gli step successivi o per il download, caricalo come artifact:

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    directories: src
    output: repomix-output.xml
    compress: true

- name: Upload Repomix output
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: repomix-output
    path: repomix-output.xml
```

## Parametri di Input dell'Action

## Avvio Rapido

Esegui questo comando nella directory del tuo progetto:

```bash
npx repomix@latest
```

Tutto qui! Troverai un file `repomix-output.xml` contenente l'intero repository in un formato adatto all'IA.

Puoi poi inviare questo file a un assistente IA con un'istruzione come:

```
Questo file contiene tutti i file del repository combinati in uno solo.
Vorrei fare refactoring del codice, quindi per favore esaminalo prima.
```

L'IA analizzerà la tua intera codebase e fornirà informazioni dettagliate:

# Server MCP

Repomix supporta il [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), permettendo agli assistenti IA di interagire direttamente con la tua codebase. Quando viene eseguito come server MCP, Repomix fornisce strumenti che permettono agli assistenti IA di impacchettare repository locali o remoti per l'analisi senza richiedere la preparazione manuale dei file.

> [!NOTE]
> Questa è una funzionalità sperimentale che miglioreremo attivamente in base ai feedback degli utenti e all'uso reale

## Eseguire Repomix come Server MCP

Per eseguire Repomix come server MCP, usa l'opzione `--mcp`:
```bash
repomix --mcp
```

Questo avvia Repomix in modalità server MCP, rendendolo disponibile per gli assistenti IA che supportano il Model Context Protocol.

## Configurazione dei Server MCP

Per usare Repomix come server MCP con assistenti IA come Claude, devi configurare le impostazioni MCP:

### Per VS Code

Puoi installare il server MCP Repomix in VS Code usando uno di questi metodi:

1. **Usando il badge di installazione:**

  [![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-VS_Code?style=flat-square&label=Install%20Server&color=0098FF)](vscode:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22repomix%22%2C%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22repomix%22%2C%22--mcp%22%5D%7D)<br>
  [![Install in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-VS_Code_Insiders?style=flat-square&label=Install%20Server&color=24bfa5)](vscode-insiders:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22repomix%22%2C%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22repomix%22%2C%22--mcp%22%5D%7D)

2. **Usando la linea di comando:**

  ```bash
  code --add-mcp '{"name":"repomix","command":"npx","args":["-y","repomix","--mcp"]}'
  ```

  Per VS Code Insiders:
  ```bash
  code-insiders --add-mcp '{"name":"repomix","command":"npx","args":["-y","repomix","--mcp"]}'
  ```

### Per Cline (estensione VS Code)

Modifica il file `cline_mcp_settings.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "repomix": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "repomix",
        "--mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Per Cursor

In Cursor, aggiungi un nuovo server MCP da `Cursor Settings` > `MCP` > `+ Add new global MCP server` con una configurazione simile a quella di Cline.

### Per Claude Desktop

Modifica il file `claude_desktop_config.json` con una configurazione simile a quella di Cline.

### Per Claude Code

Per configurare Repomix come server MCP in [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview), usa il seguente comando:

```bash
claude mcp add repomix -- npx -y repomix --mcp
```

In alternativa, puoi usare i **plugin ufficiali Repomix** per un'esperienza più comoda. I plugin forniscono comandi in linguaggio naturale e una configurazione più semplice. Consulta la documentazione [Plugin Claude Code](/it/guide/claude-code-plugins) per i dettagli.

### Usare Docker invece di npx

Invece di usare npx, puoi usare Docker per eseguire Repomix come server MCP:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "repomix-docker": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix",
        "--mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Strumenti MCP Disponibili

In modalità server MCP, Repomix fornisce i seguenti strumenti:

### pack_codebase

Questo strumento impacchetta una directory di codice locale in un file XML per l'analisi IA. Analizza la struttura della codebase, estrae il contenuto di codice rilevante e genera un report completo che include metriche, albero dei file e contenuto di codice formattato.

**Parametri:**
- `directory`: (Richiesto) Percorso assoluto alla directory da impacchettare
- `compress`: (Opzionale, predefinito: false) Abilita la compressione Tree-sitter per estrarre le firme di codice essenziali e la struttura mentre rimuove i dettagli di implementazione. Riduce l'utilizzo dei token di circa il 70% preservando il significato semantico. Generalmente non necessario poiché grep_repomix_output permette il recupero incrementale del contenuto. Usa solo quando hai specificamente bisogno del contenuto completo della codebase per repository grandi.
- `includePatterns`: (Opzionale) Specifica i file da includere usando pattern fast-glob. Più pattern possono essere separati da virgole (es: "**/*.{js,ts}", "src/**,docs/**"). Solo i file corrispondenti saranno elaborati.
- `ignorePatterns`: (Opzionale) Specifica file aggiuntivi da escludere usando pattern fast-glob. Più pattern possono essere separati da virgole (es: "test/**,*.spec.js", "node_modules/**,dist/**"). Questi pattern completano .gitignore e le esclusioni integrate.
- `topFilesLength`: (Opzionale, predefinito: 10) Numero dei file più grandi per dimensione da mostrare nel riepilogo delle metriche per l'analisi della codebase.

**Esempio:**
```json
{
  "directory": "/path/to/your/project",
  "compress": false,
  "includePatterns": "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md",
  "ignorePatterns": "**/*.log,tmp/",
  "topFilesLength": 10
}
```

### pack_remote_repository

Questo strumento recupera, clona e impacchetta un repository GitHub in un file XML per l'analisi IA. Clona automaticamente il repository remoto, analizza la sua struttura e genera un report completo.

**Parametri:**
- `remote`: (Richiesto) URL del repository GitHub o formato utente/repo (es: "yamadashy/repomix", "https://github.com/user/repo", o "https://github.com/user/repo/tree/branch")
- `compress`: (Opzionale, predefinito: false) Abilita la compressione Tree-sitter per estrarre le firme di codice essenziali e la struttura mentre rimuove i dettagli di implementazione. Riduce l'utilizzo dei token di circa il 70% preservando il significato semantico. Generalmente non necessario poiché grep_repomix_output permette il recupero incrementale del contenuto. Usa solo quando hai specificamente bisogno del contenuto completo della codebase per repository grandi.
- `includePatterns`: (Opzionale) Specifica i file da includere usando pattern fast-glob. Più pattern possono essere separati da virgole (es: "**/*.{js,ts}", "src/**,docs/**"). Solo i file corrispondenti saranno elaborati.
- `ignorePatterns`: (Opzionale) Specifica file aggiuntivi da escludere usando pattern fast-glob. Più pattern possono essere separati da virgole (es: "test/**,*.spec.js", "node_modules/**,dist/**"). Questi pattern completano .gitignore e le esclusioni integrate.
- `topFilesLength`: (Opzionale, predefinito: 10) Numero dei file più grandi per dimensione da mostrare nel riepilogo delle metriche per l'analisi della codebase.

**Esempio:**
```json
{
  "remote": "yamadashy/repomix",
  "compress": false,
  "includePatterns": "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md",
  "ignorePatterns": "**/*.log,tmp/",
  "topFilesLength": 10
}
```

### read_repomix_output

Questo strumento legge il contenuto di un file di output generato da Repomix. Supporta la lettura parziale con specifica dell'intervallo di righe per file grandi. Questo strumento è progettato per ambienti dove l'accesso diretto al file system è limitato.

**Parametri:**
- `outputId`: (Richiesto) ID del file di output Repomix da leggere
- `startLine`: (Opzionale) Numero di riga di inizio (basato su 1, incluso). Se non specificato, legge dall'inizio.
- `endLine`: (Opzionale) Numero di riga di fine (basato su 1, incluso). Se non specificato, legge fino alla fine.

**Funzionalità:**
- Progettato specificamente per ambienti basati sul web o applicazioni sandbox
- Recupera il contenuto degli output generati precedentemente usando il loro ID
- Fornisce accesso sicuro alla codebase impacchettata senza richiedere accesso al file system
- Supporta la lettura parziale per file grandi

**Esempio:**
```json
{
  "outputId": "8f7d3b1e2a9c6054",
  "startLine": 100,
  "endLine": 200
}
```

### grep_repomix_output

Questo strumento cerca pattern in un file di output Repomix usando funzionalità simili a grep con la sintassi JavaScript RegExp. Restituisce le righe corrispondenti con righe di contesto opzionali intorno alle corrispondenze.

**Parametri:**
- `outputId`: (Richiesto) ID del file di output Repomix da cercare
- `pattern`: (Richiesto) Pattern di ricerca (sintassi espressione regolare JavaScript RegExp)
- `contextLines`: (Opzionale, predefinito: 0) Numero di righe di contesto da mostrare prima e dopo ogni corrispondenza. Sovrascritto da beforeLines/afterLines se specificato.
- `beforeLines`: (Opzionale) Numero di righe di contesto da mostrare prima di ogni corrispondenza (come grep -B). Ha priorità su contextLines.
- `afterLines`: (Opzionale) Numero di righe di contesto da mostrare dopo ogni corrispondenza (come grep -A). Ha priorità su contextLines.
- `ignoreCase`: (Opzionale, predefinito: false) Esegue una corrispondenza case-insensitive

**Funzionalità:**
- Usa la sintassi JavaScript RegExp per una potente corrispondenza di pattern
- Supporta righe di contesto per una migliore comprensione delle corrispondenze
- Permette controllo separato delle righe di contesto prima/dopo
- Opzioni di ricerca case-sensitive e case-insensitive

**Esempio:**
```json
{
  "outputId": "8f7d3b1e2a9c6054",
  "pattern": "function\\s+\\w+\\(",
  "contextLines": 3,
  "ignoreCase": false
}
```

### file_system_read_file e file_system_read_directory

Il server MCP di Repomix fornisce due strumenti per il file system che permettono agli assistenti IA di interagire in sicurezza con il file system locale:

1. `file_system_read_file`
  - Legge il contenuto dei file dal file system locale usando percorsi assoluti
  - Include validazione di sicurezza integrata per rilevare e prevenire l'accesso a file contenenti informazioni sensibili
  - Implementa la validazione di sicurezza con [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint)
  - Impedisce l'accesso a file contenenti informazioni sensibili (chiavi API, password, segreti)
  - Valida i percorsi assoluti per prevenire attacchi di directory traversal
  - Restituisce messaggi di errore chiari per percorsi invalidi e problemi di sicurezza

2. `file_system_read_directory`
  - Elenca il contenuto di una directory usando un percorso assoluto
  - Restituisce una lista formattata che mostra file e sottodirectory con indicatori chiari
  - Mostra file e directory con indicatori chiari (`[FILE]` o `[DIR]`)
  - Fornisce attraversamento sicuro delle directory con gestione appropriata degli errori
  - Valida i percorsi e si assicura che siano assoluti
  - Utile per esplorare la struttura del progetto e comprendere l'organizzazione della codebase

Entrambi gli strumenti integrano robuste misure di sicurezza:
- Validazione dei percorsi assoluti per prevenire attacchi di directory traversal
- Controlli dei permessi per assicurare diritti di accesso appropriati
- Integrazione con Secretlint per il rilevamento di informazioni sensibili
- Messaggi di errore chiari per un migliore debug e consapevolezza della sicurezza

**Esempio:**
```typescript
// Lettura di un file
const fileContent = await tools.file_system_read_file({
  path: '/absolute/path/to/file.txt'
});

// Elenco del contenuto di una directory
const dirContent = await tools.file_system_read_directory({
  path: '/absolute/path/to/directory'
});
```

Questi strumenti sono particolarmente utili quando gli assistenti IA devono:
- Analizzare file specifici nella codebase
- Navigare nelle strutture delle directory
- Verificare l'esistenza e l'accessibilità dei file
- Assicurare operazioni sicure sul file system

## Vantaggi dell'Uso di Repomix come Server MCP

L'uso di Repomix come server MCP offre diversi vantaggi:

1. **Integrazione diretta**: Gli assistenti IA possono analizzare direttamente la tua codebase senza preparazione manuale dei file.
2. **Workflow efficiente**: Semplifica il processo di analisi del codice eliminando la necessità di generare e caricare manualmente i file.
3. **Output coerente**: Garantisce che l'assistente IA riceva la codebase in un formato coerente e ottimizzato.
4. **Funzionalità avanzate**: Sfrutta tutte le funzionalità di Repomix come la compressione del codice, il conteggio dei token e i controlli di sicurezza.

Una volta configurato, il tuo assistente IA può usare direttamente le capacità di Repomix per analizzare le codebase, rendendo i workflow di analisi del codice più efficienti.

# Formati di Output

Repomix supporta quattro formati di output:
- XML (predefinito)
- Markdown
- JSON
- Testo semplice

## Formato XML

```bash
repomix --style xml
```

Il formato XML è ottimizzato per l'elaborazione da parte dell'IA:

```xml
Questo file è una rappresentazione unificata dell'intera codebase...
<file_summary>
(Metadati e istruzioni per l'IA)
</file_summary>
<directory_structure>
src/
  index.ts
  utils/
    helper.ts
</directory_structure>
<files>
<file path="src/index.ts">
// Contenuto del file qui
</file>
</files>

```

### Perché XML come formato predefinito?

Repomix usa XML come formato di output predefinito basandosi su ricerche e test approfonditi. Questa decisione si fonda su prove empiriche e considerazioni pratiche per l'analisi del codice assistita dall'IA.

La nostra scelta di XML è principalmente influenzata dalle raccomandazioni ufficiali dei principali fornitori di IA:
- **Anthropic (Claude)**: Raccomanda esplicitamente l'uso di tag XML per strutturare i prompt, affermando che "Claude è stato esposto a tali prompt durante l'addestramento" ([documentazione](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/use-xml-tags))
- **Google (Gemini)**: Raccomanda formati strutturati incluso XML per compiti complessi ([documentazione](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/structure-prompts))
- **OpenAI (GPT)**: Sostiene il prompting strutturato in scenari complessi ([annuncio](https://x.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1890147300493914437), [cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5_prompting_guide))

## Formato Markdown

```bash
repomix --style markdown
```

Il Markdown offre una formattazione leggibile:

````markdown
Questo file è una rappresentazione unificata dell'intera codebase...
# Riepilogo File
(Metadati e istruzioni per l'IA)
# Struttura Directory
```
src/

## Formato JSON

```bash
repomix --style json
```

Il formato JSON fornisce un output strutturato e accessibile programmaticamente con nomi di proprietà in camelCase:

```json
{
  "fileSummary": {
    "generationHeader": "Questo file è una rappresentazione unificata dell'intera codebase, combinata in un singolo documento da Repomix.",
    "purpose": "Questo file contiene una rappresentazione compatta del contenuto dell'intero repository...",
    "fileFormat": "Il contenuto è organizzato come segue...",
    "usageGuidelines": "- Questo file dovrebbe essere trattato come di sola lettura...",
    "notes": "- Alcuni file potrebbero essere stati esclusi secondo le regole .gitignore..."
  },
  "userProvidedHeader": "Testo di intestazione personalizzato se specificato",
  "directoryStructure": "src/
  cli/
    cliOutput.ts
    index.ts
  config/
    configLoader.ts",
  "files": {
    "src/index.js": "// Contenuto del file qui",
    "src/utils.js": "// Contenuto del file qui"
  },
  "instruction": "Istruzioni personalizzate da instructionFilePath"
}
```

### Vantaggi del Formato JSON

Il formato JSON è ideale per:
- **Elaborazione programmatica**: Facile da analizzare e manipolare con librerie JSON in qualsiasi linguaggio di programmazione
- **Integrazione API**: Consumo diretto da servizi web e applicazioni
- **Compatibilità strumenti IA**: Formato strutturato ottimizzato per machine learning e sistemi IA
- **Analisi dati**: Estrazione semplice di informazioni specifiche con strumenti come `jq`

### Lavorare con l'Output JSON usando `jq`

Il formato JSON facilita l'estrazione programmatica di informazioni specifiche. Ecco esempi comuni:

#### Operazioni Base sui File
```bash
# Elenca tutti i percorsi dei file
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[]'

# Conta il numero totale di file
cat repomix-output.json | jq '.files | keys | length'

# Estrai il contenuto di un file specifico
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files["README.md"]'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files["src/index.js"]'
```

#### Filtraggio e Analisi File
```bash
# Trova file per estensione
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(endswith(".ts"))'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(endswith(".js") or endswith(".ts"))'

# Ottieni file contenenti testo specifico
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | select(.value | contains("function")) | .key'

# Crea una lista di file con conteggio caratteri
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | "\(.key): \(.value | length) caratteri"'
```

#### Estrazione Metadati
```bash
# Estrai la struttura delle directory
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.directoryStructure'

# Ottieni le informazioni del riepilogo file
cat repomix-output.json | jq '.fileSummary.purpose'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.fileSummary.generationHeader'

# Estrai l'intestazione fornita dall'utente (se esiste)
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.userProvidedHeader // "Nessuna intestazione fornita"'

# Ottieni le istruzioni personalizzate
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.instruction // "Nessuna istruzione fornita"'
```

#### Analisi Avanzata
```bash
# Trova i file più grandi per lunghezza del contenuto
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | [.key, (.value | length)] | @tsv' | sort -k2 -nr | head -10

# Cerca file contenenti pattern specifici
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | select(.value | test("import.*react"; "i")) | .key'

# Estrai percorsi di file corrispondenti a multiple estensioni
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(test("\.(js|ts|jsx|tsx)$"))'
```

## Formato Testo Semplice

```bash
repomix --style plain
```

Struttura di output:

```text
Questo file è una rappresentazione unificata dell'intera codebase...

## Utilizzo con i Modelli IA

Ogni formato funziona bene con i modelli IA, ma considera:
- Usa XML per Claude (migliore precisione nell'analisi)
- Usa Markdown per una migliore leggibilità generale
- Usa JSON per l'elaborazione programmatica e l'integrazione API
- Usa testo semplice per semplicità e compatibilità universale

## Personalizzazione

Imposta il formato predefinito in `repomix.config.json`:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "style": "xml",
    "filePath": "output.xml"
  }
}
```

# Sicurezza

## Funzionalità di Controllo Sicurezza

Repomix utilizza [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint) per rilevare informazioni sensibili nei tuoi file:
- Chiavi API
- Token di accesso
- Credenziali
- Chiavi private
- Variabili d'ambiente

## Configurazione

I controlli di sicurezza sono abilitati per impostazione predefinita.

Disabilitazione tramite CLI:
```bash
repomix --no-security-check
```

O in `repomix.config.json`:
```json
{
  "security": {
    "enableSecurityCheck": false
  }
}
```

## Misure di Sicurezza

1. **Gestione file binari**: I contenuti dei file binari sono esclusi dall'output, ma i loro percorsi sono elencati nella struttura delle directory per una panoramica completa del repository
2. **Compatibile con Git**: Rispetta i pattern `.gitignore`
3. **Rilevamento automatizzato**: Analizza i problemi di sicurezza comuni:
    - Credenziali AWS
    - Stringhe di connessione ai database
    - Token di autenticazione
    - Chiavi private

## Quando il Controllo di Sicurezza Trova Problemi

Esempio di output:
```bash
🔍 Controllo sicurezza:
────────────────────────────
2 file sospetti rilevati ed esclusi:
1. config/credentials.json
  - Chiave di accesso AWS trovata
2. .env.local
  - Password del database trovata
```

## Best Practice

1. Esaminare sempre l'output prima di condividerlo
2. Usare `.repomixignore` per percorsi sensibili
3. Mantenere i controlli di sicurezza abilitati
4. Rimuovere i file sensibili dal repository

## Segnalazione Problemi di Sicurezza

Hai trovato una vulnerabilità di sicurezza? Per favore:
1. Non aprire un ticket pubblico
2. Invia un'email a: koukun0120@gmail.com
3. Oppure usa gli [Avvisi di Sicurezza GitHub](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/security/advisories/new)

`````markdown
# Utilizzo Base

## Avvio Rapido

Impacchetta l'intero repository:

```bash
repomix
```

## Casi d'Uso Comuni

### Impacchettare Directory Specifiche

```bash
repomix path/to/directory
```

### Includere File Specifici

Usa i [pattern glob](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax):

```bash
repomix --include "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md"
```

### Escludere File

```bash
repomix --ignore "**/*.log,tmp/"
```

### Repository Remoti

```bash
# Usando l'URL GitHub
repomix --remote https://github.com/user/repo
# Usando il formato abbreviato
repomix --remote user/repo
# Branch/tag/commit specifico
repomix --remote user/repo --remote-branch main
repomix --remote user/repo --remote-branch 935b695
```

### Input Lista File (stdin)

Passa i percorsi dei file tramite stdin per la massima flessibilità:

```bash
# Usando il comando find
find src -name "*.ts" -type f | repomix --stdin

# Usando git per ottenere i file tracciati
git ls-files "*.ts" | repomix --stdin

# Usando grep per trovare file contenenti contenuto specifico
grep -l "TODO" **/*.ts | repomix --stdin

# Usando ripgrep per trovare file con contenuto specifico
rg -l "TODO|FIXME" --type ts | repomix --stdin

# Usando ripgrep (rg) per trovare file
rg --files --type ts | repomix --stdin

# Usando sharkdp/fd per trovare file
fd -e ts | repomix --stdin

# Usando fzf per selezionare da tutti i file
fzf -m | repomix --stdin

# Selezione interattiva di file con fzf
find . -name "*.ts" -type f | fzf -m | repomix --stdin

# Usando ls con pattern glob
ls src/**/*.ts | repomix --stdin

# Da un file contenente percorsi di file
cat file-list.txt | repomix --stdin

# Input diretto con echo
echo -e "src/index.ts\nsrc/utils.ts" | repomix --stdin
```

L'opzione `--stdin` ti permette di passare una lista di percorsi di file a Repomix, offrendo la massima flessibilità nella selezione dei file da impacchettare.

Quando usi `--stdin`, i file specificati vengono effettivamente aggiunti ai pattern di inclusione. Questo significa che il normale comportamento di inclusione ed esclusione si applica comunque - i file specificati tramite stdin saranno comunque esclusi se corrispondono ai pattern di esclusione.

> [!NOTE]
> Quando usi `--stdin`, i percorsi dei file possono essere relativi o assoluti, e Repomix gestirà automaticamente la risoluzione dei percorsi e la deduplicazione.

### Compressione Codice

```bash
repomix --compress

# Puoi usarlo anche con repository remoti:
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix --compress
```

### Integrazione Git

Includi informazioni Git per fornire contesto di sviluppo per l'analisi IA:

```bash
# Includi i diff git (modifiche non committate)
repomix --include-diffs

# Includi i log dei commit git (ultimi 50 commit per impostazione predefinita)
repomix --include-logs

# Includi un numero specifico di commit
repomix --include-logs --include-logs-count 10

# Includi sia diff che log
repomix --include-diffs --include-logs
```

Questo aggiunge contesto prezioso su:
- **Modifiche recenti**: I diff Git mostrano le modifiche non committate
- **Pattern di sviluppo**: I log Git rivelano quali file vengono tipicamente modificati insieme
- **Cronologia dei commit**: I messaggi dei commit recenti danno un'idea del focus di sviluppo
- **Relazioni tra file**: Comprendere quali file vengono modificati negli stessi commit

### Ottimizzazione del Conteggio Token

Capire la distribuzione dei token della tua codebase è cruciale per ottimizzare le interazioni IA. Usa l'opzione `--token-count-tree` per visualizzare l'utilizzo dei token nell'intero progetto:

```bash
repomix --token-count-tree
```

Questo mostra una vista gerarchica della tua codebase con i conteggi dei token:

```
🔢 Token Count Tree:
────────────────────
└── src/ (70,925 tokens)
    ├── cli/ (12,714 tokens)
    │   ├── actions/ (7,546 tokens)
    │   └── reporters/ (990 tokens)
    └── core/ (41,600 tokens)
        ├── file/ (10,098 tokens)
        └── output/ (5,808 tokens)
```

Puoi anche impostare una soglia minima di token per concentrarti sui file più grandi:

```bash
repomix --token-count-tree 1000  # Mostra solo file/directory con 1000+ token
```

Questo ti aiuta a:
- **Identificare file pesanti di token** - che potrebbero superare i limiti di contesto IA
- **Ottimizzare la selezione dei file** - usando i pattern `--include` e `--ignore`
- **Pianificare strategie di compressione** - mirando ai maggiori contributori
- **Bilanciare contenuto vs contesto** - quando prepari il codice per l'analisi IA

## Formati di Output

### XML (Predefinito)

```bash
repomix --style xml
```

### Markdown

```bash
repomix --style markdown
```

### JSON

```bash
repomix --style json
```

### Testo Semplice

```bash
repomix --style plain
```

## Opzioni Aggiuntive

```

Oppure installalo globalmente per un uso ripetuto:

```bash
# Installazione con npm
npm install -g repomix

# O con yarn
yarn global add repomix

# O con bun
bun add -g repomix

# O con Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
brew install repomix

# Poi eseguilo in qualsiasi directory di progetto
repomix
```

Tutto qui! Repomix genererà un file `repomix-output.xml` nella tua directory corrente, contenente l'intero repository in un formato adatto all'IA.

### Utilizzo

Per impacchettare l'intero repository:

```bash
repomix
```

Per impacchettare una directory specifica:

```bash
repomix path/to/directory
```

Per impacchettare file o directory specifici usando [pattern glob](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax):

```bash
repomix --include "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md"
```

Per escludere file o directory specifici:

```bash
repomix --ignore "**/*.log,tmp/"
```

Per impacchettare un repository remoto:
```bash
# Usando il formato abbreviato
npx repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix

# Usando l'URL completo (supporta branch e percorsi specifici)
npx repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix
npx repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/tree/main

`````markdown
# ライブラリとしての使用

RepomixはCLIツールとしてだけでなく、Node.jsアプリケーションに直接組み込んで機能を利用することもできます。

## インストール

プロジェクトの依存関係としてRepomixをインストールします：

```bash
npm install repomix
```

## 基本的な使い方

Repomixを使用する最も簡単な方法は、コマンドラインインターフェースと同様の機能を提供する`runCli`関数を使用することです：

```javascript
import { runCli, type CliOptions } from 'repomix';

// カスタムオプションで現在のディレクトリを処理
async function packProject() {
  const options = {
    output: 'output.xml',
    style: 'xml',
    compress: true,
    quiet: true
  } as CliOptions;
  
  const result = await runCli(['.'], process.cwd(), options);
  return result.packResult;
}
```

`result.packResult`には、処理されたファイルに関する以下の情報が含まれています：
- `totalFiles`: 処理されたファイル数
- `totalCharacters`: 総文字数
- `totalTokens`: 総トークン数（LLMのコンテキスト制限に役立ちます）
- `fileCharCounts`: ファイルごとの文字数
- `fileTokenCounts`: ファイルごとのトークン数

## リモートリポジトリの処理

リモートリポジトリをクローンして処理することもできます：

```javascript
import { runCli, type CliOptions } from 'repomix';

// GitHubリポジトリをクローンして処理する
async function processRemoteRepo(repoUrl) {
  const options = {
    remote: repoUrl,
    output: 'output.xml',
    compress: true
  } as CliOptions;
  
  return await runCli(['.'], process.cwd(), options);
}
```

## コアコンポーネントの使用

より詳細な制御が必要な場合は、Repomixの低レベルAPIを直接使用できます：

```javascript
import { searchFiles, collectFiles, processFiles, TokenCounter } from 'repomix';

async function analyzeFiles(directory) {
  // ファイルを検索して収集
  const { filePaths } = await searchFiles(directory, { /* 設定 */ });
  const rawFiles = await collectFiles(filePaths, directory);
  const processedFiles = await processFiles(rawFiles, { /* 設定 */ });
  
  // トークンをカウント
  const tokenCounter = new TokenCounter('o200k_base');
  
  // 分析結果を返す
  return processedFiles.map(file => ({
    path: file.path,
    tokens: tokenCounter.countTokens(file.content)
  }));
}
```

## 実世界の例

Repomixウェブサイト（[repomix.com](https://repomix.com)）では、ライブラリとしてRepomixを使用してリモートリポジトリを処理しています。実装は[website/server/src/remoteRepo.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/....ts)で確認できます。

# AI支援開発のベストプラクティス：私の経験から

私はまだAIを使用した大規模な開発を経験したわけではありませんが、これまでの経験から学んだことを共有したいと思います。

## 開発の基本アプローチ

AIと共に開発を進める際、一度にすべての機能を実装しようとすると、予期せぬ問題が発生し、プロジェクト全体が行き詰まってしまうことがあります。そのため、コア機能から始めて一つ一つの機能を確実に作り上げていく方法が効果的です。

### 既存コードの重要性

この方法が効果的な理由は、コア機能の実装を通じて、あなたの理想とする設計やコーディングスタイルをコードとして具体化できる点にあります。
プロジェクトのビジョンを最も効果的に伝えるのは、あなたの基準や好みを反映したコードそのものなのです。

コア機能から始めつつ、一つ一つの機能を確実に動く状態にしてから次の機能に進むことで、プロジェクト全体が一貫性を持ち、AIがより適切なコードを生成しやすくなります。

## モジュール分割のアプローチ

また、コードは小さなモジュールに分割することが重要です。私の経験では、行数を250行程度に抑えることで結果的にAIに明確な指示を与えやすくなり、試行錯誤のプロセスも効率的になります。実際にはトークン数のほうが指標として正しいのですが、人間に判断しやすいのは行数なので、ここでは行数としています。

これはフロントエンド、バックエンド、データベースなどの大きな単位の話ではなく、もっと小さな単位、例えば一つの機能の中でもバリデーションやエラーハンドリングなど、個別の機能をモジュールとして分割することが重要です。

もちろん大きな単位で分けるのも重要で、段階的にモジュールを分割しておくことで、指示も明確になり、AIがより適切なコードを生成しやすくなります。AIに限らず人間にも効果的なアプローチですね。


## テストを通じた品質の確保
私はテストも重要だと考えています。
テストは単なる品質保証の手段としてだけでなく、コードの意図を明確に示すドキュメントとしても機能します。AIに新しい機能の実装を依頼する際、既存のテストコードは実装すべき機能の仕様書として働きます。

また、AIが生成したコードの正しさを判断する際、テストは非常に効果的なツールとなります。例えば、あるモジュールの新しい機能をAIに実装してもらう場合、テストケースを先に書いておくことで、生成されたコードが期待通りの動作をするかを客観的に評価できます。これはテスト駆動開発（TDD）の考え方とも親和性が高く、AIとの協業において特に有効です。


## 計画と実装のバランス

大規模な機能を実装する前には、まずAIと計画について話し合うことをお勧めします。要件を整理し、アーキテクチャを検討することで、後の実装がスムーズになります。要件をまずまとめて、別のチャットに移動して実装を進めるのも良いでしょう。
また、AIの出力は必ず人間がレビューし、必要に応じて調整を加えることが重要です。AIの出力の品質は一般的に中程度ですが、それでも一からコードを書くよりも開発速度は向上します。



## まとめ

この方法を実践することで、AIの強みを活かしながら、一貫性のある高品質なコードベースを構築できます。プロジェクトの規模が大きくなっても、各部分が明確に定義され、管理しやすい状態を維持できるでしょう。

# Agent Skills生成

Repomixは[Claude Agent Skills](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills)形式の出力を生成できます。これにより、AIアシスタントの再利用可能なコードベースリファレンスとして使用できる構造化されたSkillsディレクトリが作成されます。

この機能は、特にリモートリポジトリの実装を参考にしたい場合に真価を発揮します。オープンソースプロジェクトからSkillsを生成することで、自分のコードを書きながらClaudeに特定のパターンや実装を参照させることが簡単にできます。

単一のパッキングファイルを生成する代わりに、Skills生成はAIの理解とgrep検索に最適化された複数のリファレンスファイルを含む構造化されたディレクトリを作成します。

> [!NOTE]
> これは実験的な機能です。出力形式やオプションは、ユーザーのフィードバックに基づいて今後のリリースで変更される可能性があります。

## 基本的な使い方

ローカルディレクトリからSkillsを生成します：

```bash
# カレントディレクトリからSkillsを生成
repomix --skill-generate

# カスタムSkills名で生成
repomix --skill-generate my-project-reference

# 特定のディレクトリから生成
repomix path/to/directory --skill-generate

# リモートリポジトリから生成
repomix --remote https://github.com/user/repo --skill-generate
```

## Skills保存先の選択

コマンドを実行すると、RepomixはSkillsの保存先を選択するよう促します：

1. **Personal Skills** (`~/.claude/skills/`) - マシン上のすべてのプロジェクトで利用可能
2. **Project Skills** (`.claude/skills/`) - gitを通じてチームと共有

Skillsディレクトリが既に存在する場合は、上書きの確認が求められます。

> [!TIP]
> Project Skillsを生成する場合は、大きなファイルのコミットを避けるため`.gitignore`への追加を検討してください：
> ```gitignore
> .claude/skills/repomix-reference-*/
> ```

## 生成される構造

Skillsは以下の構造で生成されます：

```text
.claude/skills/<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md                    # メインのSkillsメタデータとドキュメント
└── references/
    ├── summary.md              # 目的、フォーマット、統計情報
    ├── project-structure.md    # 行数付きディレクトリツリー
    ├── files.md                # すべてのファイル内容（grep検索向け）
    └── tech-stack.md           # 言語、フレームワーク、依存関係
```

### ファイルの説明

#### SKILL.md

メインのSkillsファイルで、以下を含みます：
- Skills名、説明、プロジェクト情報
- ファイル数、行数、トークン数
- Skillsの使用方法の概要
- ファイルの場所とフォーマットの説明
- 一般的なユースケースとヒント

#### references/summary.md

以下を含みます：
- **目的**: AI利用のためのリファレンスコードベースであることを説明
- **ファイル構造**: 各リファレンスファイルの内容を文書化
- **使用ガイドライン**: Skillsを効果的に使用する方法
- **統計情報**: ファイルタイプ、言語、最大ファイルの内訳

#### references/project-structure.md

ファイル探索を容易にするための、各ファイルの行数付きディレクトリツリー：

```text
src/
  index.ts (42 lines)
  utils/
    helpers.ts (128 lines)
    math.ts (87 lines)
```

#### references/files.md

grep検索に最適化された、シンタックスハイライト付きのすべてのファイル内容：

````markdown
## File: src/index.ts
```typescript
import { sum } from './utils/helpers';

export function main() {
  console.log(sum(1, 2));
}
```
````

#### references/tech-stack.md

依存関係ファイルから自動検出される技術スタック：
- **言語**: TypeScript、JavaScript、Python など
- **フレームワーク**: React、Next.js、Express、Django など
- **ランタイムバージョン**: Node.js、Python、Go など
- **パッケージマネージャー**: npm、pnpm、poetry など
- **依存関係**: すべての直接依存と開発依存
- **設定ファイル**: 検出されたすべての設定ファイル

検出対象ファイル: `package.json`、`requirements.txt`、`Cargo.toml`、`go.mod`、`.nvmrc`、`pyproject.toml` など

## 自動生成されるSkills名

名前が指定されない場合、Repomixは以下のパターンで自動生成します：

```bash
repomix src/ --skill-generate                # → repomix-reference-src
repomix --remote user/repo --skill-generate  # → repomix-reference-repo
repomix --skill-generate CustomName          # → custom-name（ケバブケースに正規化）
```

Skills名は：
- ケバブケース（小文字、ハイフン区切り）に変換
- 最大64文字に制限
- パストラバーサルから保護

## Repomixオプションとの統合

Skills生成はすべての標準Repomixオプションを尊重します：

```bash
# ファイルフィルタリング付きでSkillsを生成
repomix --skill-generate --include "src/**/*.ts" --ignore "**/*.test.ts"

# 圧縮付きでSkillsを生成
repomix --skill-generate --compress

# リモートリポジトリからSkillsを生成
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix --skill-generate

# 特定の出力フォーマットオプションでSkillsを生成
repomix --skill-generate --remove-comments --remove-empty-lines
```

### ドキュメントのみのSkills

`--include`を使用すると、GitHubリポジトリからドキュメントのみを含むSkillsを生成できます。これは、コードを書きながらClaudeに特定のライブラリやフレームワークのドキュメントを参照させたい場合に便利です：

```bash
# Claude Code Actionのドキュメント
repomix --remote https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action --include docs --skill-generate

# Viteのドキュメント
repomix --remote https://github.com/vitejs/vite --include docs --skill-generate

# Reactのドキュメント
repomix --remote https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev --include src/content --skill-generate
```

## 制限事項

`--skill-generate`オプションは以下と併用できません：
- `--stdout` - Skills出力にはファイルシステムへの書き込みが必要
- `--copy` - Skills出力はディレクトリであり、クリップボードにコピー不可

## 生成されたSkillsの使用

生成されたSkillsはClaudeで以下のように使用できます：

1. **Claude Code**: `~/.claude/skills/`または`.claude/skills/`に保存された場合、自動的に利用可能
2. **Claude Web**: コードベース分析のためにSkillsディレクトリをClaudeにアップロード
3. **チーム共有**: チーム全体でアクセスできるように`.claude/skills/`をリポジトリにコミット

## 使用例ワークフロー

### 個人用リファレンスライブラリの作成

```bash
# 興味のあるオープンソースプロジェクトをクローンして分析
repomix --remote facebook/react --skill-generate react-reference

# Skillsは ~/.claude/skills/react-reference/ に保存される
# これで任意のClaudeの会話でReactのコードベースを参照できる
```

### チームプロジェクトのドキュメント

```bash
# プロジェクトディレクトリで
cd my-project

# チーム用のSkillsを生成
repomix --skill-generate

# プロンプトで「Project Skills」を選択
# Skillsは .claude/skills/repomix-reference-my-project/ に保存される

# コミットしてチームと共有
git add .claude/skills/
git commit -m "Add codebase reference Skills"
```

## File: website/client/src/ja/guide/code-compress.md
`````markdown
# コード圧縮
コード圧縮は、実装の詳細を省きながら、コードの本質的な構造を抽出する強力な機能です。トークン数を削減しながらコードベースの重要な構造情報を維持したい場合に特に有用です。

> [!NOTE]
> これは実験的な機能であり、ユーザーのフィードバックや実際の使用状況に基づいて積極的に改善を行っています。

## 基本的な使い方

`--compress`フラグを使用してコード圧縮を有効にします：

```bash
repomix --compress
```

リモートリポジトリでも使用できます：

```bash
repomix --remote user/repo --compress
```

## 仕組み

圧縮アルゴリズムは、tree-sitterパーシングを使用してコードを処理し、本質的な構造要素を抽出・保持しながら、実装の詳細を除外します。

圧縮で保持される要素：
- 関数やメソッドのシグネチャ
- インターフェースと型定義
- クラス構造とプロパティ
- 重要な構造的要素

以下の要素は除外されます：
- 関数やメソッドの実装内容
- ループや条件分岐のロジック詳細
- 内部変数の宣言
- 実装固有のコード

### 例

元のTypeScriptコード：

```typescript
import { ShoppingItem } from './shopping-item';

/**
 * Calculate the total price of shopping items
 */
const calculateTotal = (
  items: ShoppingItem[]
) => {
  let total = 0;
  for (const item of items) {
    total += item.price * item.quantity;
  }
  return total;
}

// Shopping item interface
interface Item {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  quantity: number;
}
```

圧縮後：

```typescript
import { ShoppingItem } from './shopping-item';
⋮----
/**
 * Calculate the total price of shopping items
 */
const calculateTotal = (
  items: ShoppingItem[]
) => {
⋮----
// Shopping item interface
interface Item {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  quantity: number;
}
```

## 設定

設定ファイルで圧縮を有効にすることもできます：

```json
{
  "output": {
    "compress": true
  }
}
```

## ユースケース

コード圧縮は以下のような場合に特に有用です：
- コードの構造やアーキテクチャの分析
- LLM処理のためのトークン数削減
- 高レベルなドキュメントの作成
- コードパターンやシグネチャの理解
- APIやインターフェース設計の共有

## 関連オプション

圧縮は以下のオプションと組み合わせることができます：
- `--remove-comments`: コードコメントを削除
- `--remove-empty-lines`: 空行を削除
- `--output-show-line-numbers`: 出力に行番号を追加
`````

# ソースコード中のコメント削除

Repomixは、パッケージング時に、ソースコード中のコメントを自動的に削除する機能を提供します。これにより、出力ファイルからノイズを減らし、実際のコードに焦点を当てることができます。

## 使用方法

コメントの削除を有効にするには、`repomix.config.json`で`removeComments`オプションを`true`に設定します。

```json
{
  "output": {
    "removeComments": true
  }
}
```

## サポートされている言語

Repomixは以下を含む多くのプログラミング言語のコメント削除をサポートしています。

- JavaScript/TypeScript (`//`, `/* */`)
- Python (`#`, `"""`, `'''`)
- Java (`//`, `/* */`)
- C/C++ (`//`, `/* */`)
- HTML (`<!-- -->`)
- CSS (`/* */`)
- その他多数の言語

## 使用例と出力例

以下のようなJavaScriptコードがある場合

```javascript
// これは単一行コメントです
function test() {
  /* これは
     複数行コメントです */
  return true;
}
```

コメント削除を有効にすると、出力は以下のようになります。

```javascript
function test() {
  return true;
}
```

## 制限事項

- コメントの削除は、行番号の追加など、他の処理よりも先に行われます。
- JSDocコメントなど、一部のコメントは削除されない場合があります。

## File: website/client/src/ja/guide/configuration.md
`````markdown
# 設定

Repomixは設定ファイルまたはコマンドラインオプションを使用して設定できます。設定ファイルを使用することで、コードベースの処理と出力方法をカスタマイズできます。

## 設定ファイルの形式

Repomixは柔軟性と使いやすさのために、複数の設定ファイル形式をサポートしています。

Repomixは以下の優先順位で設定ファイルを自動的に検索します：

1. **TypeScript** (`repomix.config.ts`、`repomix.config.mts`、`repomix.config.cts`)
2. **JavaScript/ES Module** (`repomix.config.js`、`repomix.config.mjs`、`repomix.config.cjs`)
3. **JSON** (`repomix.config.json5`、`repomix.config.jsonc`、`repomix.config.json`)

### JSON設定

プロジェクトディレクトリに設定ファイルを作成します：
```bash
repomix --init
```

これにより、デフォルト設定の`repomix.config.json`ファイルが作成されます。また、ローカル設定が見つからない場合のフォールバックとして使用されるグローバル設定ファイルを作成することもできます：

```bash
repomix --init --global
```

### TypeScript設定

TypeScript設定ファイルは、完全な型チェックとIDEサポートにより、最高の開発者体験を提供します。

**インストール:**

`defineConfig`を使用してTypeScriptまたはJavaScript設定を使用するには、Repomixをdev dependencyとしてインストールする必要があります：

```bash
npm install -D repomix
```

**例:**

```typescript
// repomix.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'repomix';

export default defineConfig({
  output: {
    filePath: 'output.xml',
    style: 'xml',
    removeComments: true,
  },
  ignore: {
    customPatterns: ['**/node_modules/**', '**/dist/**'],
  },
});
```

**利点:**
- ✅ IDEでの完全なTypeScript型チェック
- ✅ 優れたIDE自動補完とIntelliSense
- ✅ 動的な値（タイムスタンプ、環境変数など）の使用

**動的な値の例:**

```typescript
// repomix.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'repomix';

// タイムスタンプベースのファイル名を生成
const timestamp = new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 19).replace(/[:.]/g, '-');

export default defineConfig({
  output: {
    filePath: `output-${timestamp}.xml`,
    style: 'xml',
  },
});
```

### JavaScript設定

JavaScript設定ファイルはTypeScriptと同様に機能し、`defineConfig`と動的な値をサポートしています。

設定ファイルは[JSON5](https://json5.org/)構文をサポートしており、以下が可能です：
- コメント（単一行および複数行）
- オブジェクトと配列の末尾のカンマ
- 引用符なしのプロパティ名
- より柔軟な文字列構文

## スキーマ検証

設定ファイルに`$schema`プロパティを追加することで、スキーマ検証を有効にできます：

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://repomix.com/schemas/latest/schema.json",
  "output": {
    "filePath": "repomix-output.md",
    "style": "markdown"
  }
}
```

これにより、JSONスキーマをサポートするエディタでの自動補完と検証が可能になります。

## 設定ファイルの例

以下は完全な設定ファイル（`repomix.config.json`）の例です：

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://repomix.com/schemas/latest/schema.json",
  "input": {
    "maxFileSize": 50000000
  },
  "output": {
    "filePath": "repomix-output.xml",
    "style": "xml",
    "parsableStyle": false,
    "compress": false,
    "headerText": "パッケージ化されたファイルのカスタムヘッダー情報",
    "fileSummary": true,
    "directoryStructure": true,
    "files": true,
    "removeComments": false,
    "removeEmptyLines": false,
    "topFilesLength": 5,
    "showLineNumbers": false,
    "truncateBase64": false,
    "copyToClipboard": false,
    "includeEmptyDirectories": false,
    "git": {
      "sortByChanges": true,
      "sortByChangesMaxCommits": 100,
      "includeDiffs": false,
      "includeLogs": false,
      "includeLogsCount": 50
    }
  },
  "include": ["**/*"],
  "ignore": {
    "useGitignore": true,
    "useDefaultPatterns": true,
    // パターンは .repomixignore でも指定できます
    "customPatterns": [
      "additional-folder",
      "**/*.log"
    ],
  },
  "security": {
    "enableSecurityCheck": true
  },
  "tokenCount": {
    "encoding": "o200k_base"
  }
}
```

## 設定ファイルの場所

Repomixは以下の順序で設定ファイルを探します：
1. カレントディレクトリのローカル設定ファイル（優先順位: TS > JS > JSON）
   - TypeScript: `repomix.config.ts`、`repomix.config.mts`、`repomix.config.cts`
   - JavaScript: `repomix.config.js`、`repomix.config.mjs`、`repomix.config.cjs`
   - JSON: `repomix.config.json5`、`repomix.config.jsonc`、`repomix.config.json`
2. グローバル設定ファイル（優先順位: TS > JS > JSON）
   - Windows:
     - TypeScript: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.ts`、`.mts`、`.cts`
     - JavaScript: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.js`、`.mjs`、`.cjs`
     - JSON: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.json5`、`.jsonc`、`.json`
   - macOS/Linux:
     - TypeScript: `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.ts`、`.mts`、`.cts`
     - JavaScript: `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.js`、`.mjs`、`.cjs`
     - JSON: `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.json5`、`.jsonc`、`.json`

コマンドラインオプションは設定ファイルの設定よりも優先されます。

## インクルードパターン

Repomixは[globパターン](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax)を使用して含めるファイルを指定できます。これにより、より柔軟で強力なファイル選択が可能になります：

- `**/*.js`を使用して、任意のディレクトリ内のすべてのJavaScriptファイルを含める
- `src/**/*`を使用して、`src`ディレクトリとそのサブディレクトリ内のすべてのファイルを含める
- `["src/**/*.js", "**/*.md"]`のように複数のパターンを組み合わせて、`src`内のJavaScriptファイルとすべてのMarkdownファイルを含める

設定ファイルでインクルードパターンを指定できます：

```json
{
  "include": ["src/**/*", "tests/**/*.test.js"]
}
```

または、一時的なフィルタリングには`--include`コマンドラインオプションを使用します。

## 除外パターン

Repomixは、パッキングプロセス中に特定のファイルやディレクトリを除外するための複数の方法を提供します：

- **.gitignore**: デフォルトでは、プロジェクトの`.gitignore`ファイルと`.git/info/exclude`にリストされているパターンが使用されます。この動作は`ignore.useGitignore`設定または`--no-gitignore` CLIオプションで制御できます。
- **.ignore**: プロジェクトルートに`.ignore`ファイルを使用できます。`.gitignore`と同じ形式に従います。このファイルはripgrepやthe silver searcherなどのツールでも尊重されるため、複数の除外ファイルを維持する必要が減ります。この動作は`ignore.useDotIgnore`設定または`--no-dot-ignore` CLIオプションで制御できます。
- **デフォルトパターン**: Repomixには、一般的に除外されるファイルとディレクトリのデフォルトリスト（例：node_modules、.git、バイナリファイル）が含まれています。この機能は`ignore.useDefaultPatterns`設定または`--no-default-patterns` CLIオプションで制御できます。詳細は[defaultIgnore.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/src/config/defaultIgnore.ts)を参照してください。
- **.repomixignore**: プロジェクトルートに`.repomixignore`ファイルを作成して、Repomix固有の除外パターンを定義できます。このファイルは`.gitignore`と同じ形式に従います。
- **カスタムパターン**: 設定ファイルの`ignore.customPatterns`オプションを使用して、追加の除外パターンを指定できます。この設定は`-i, --ignore`コマンドラインオプションで上書きできます。

**優先順位**（高い順）：

1. カスタムパターン（`ignore.customPatterns`）
2. 除外ファイル（`.repomixignore`、`.ignore`、`.gitignore`、`.git/info/exclude`）：
   - ネストされたディレクトリにある場合、より深いディレクトリのファイルが優先されます
   - 同じディレクトリにある場合、これらのファイルは順不同でマージされます
3. デフォルトパターン（`ignore.useDefaultPatterns`がtrueで`--no-default-patterns`が使用されていない場合）

このアプローチにより、プロジェクトのニーズに基づいて柔軟なファイル除外設定が可能になります。セキュリティ上機密性の高いファイルや大きなバイナリファイルの除外を確実にし、機密情報の漏洩を防ぎながら、生成されるパックファイルのサイズを最適化するのに役立ちます。

**注意:** バイナリファイルはデフォルトではパック出力に含まれませんが、そのパスは出力ファイルの「リポジトリ構造」セクションにリストされます。これにより、パックファイルを効率的でテキストベースに保ちながら、リポジトリ構造の完全な概要が提供されます。詳細は[バイナリファイルの処理](#バイナリファイルの処理)を参照してください。

`.repomixignore`の例：
```text
# キャッシュディレクトリ
.cache/
tmp/

# ビルド出力
dist/
build/

# ログ
*.log
```

## デフォルトの除外パターン

`ignore.useDefaultPatterns`がtrueの場合、Repomixは以下のような一般的なパターンを自動的に除外します：
```text
node_modules/**
.git/**
coverage/**
dist/**
```

完全なリストは[defaultIgnore.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/src/config/defaultIgnore.ts)を参照してください。

## バイナリファイルの処理

バイナリファイル（画像、PDF、コンパイル済みバイナリ、アーカイブなど）は、効率的なテキストベースの出力を維持するために特別に処理されます：

- **ファイル内容**: バイナリファイルは、ファイルをテキストベースに保ち、AI処理に効率的にするために、パック出力に**含まれません**
- **ディレクトリ構造**: バイナリファイルの**パスはリストされ**、ディレクトリ構造セクションに表示され、リポジトリの完全な概要を提供します

このアプローチにより、AI向けに最適化された効率的なテキストベースの出力を維持しながら、リポジトリ構造の完全なビューを取得できます。

**例：**

リポジトリに`logo.png`と`app.jar`が含まれている場合：
- ディレクトリ構造セクションに表示されます
- その内容はファイルセクションに含まれません

**ディレクトリ構造出力：**
```
src/
  index.ts
  utils.ts
assets/
  logo.png
build/
  app.jar
```

これにより、AIツールはこれらのバイナリファイルがプロジェクト構造に存在することを理解できますが、そのバイナリ内容は処理しません。

**注意:** `input.maxFileSize`設定オプション（デフォルト：50MB）を使用して、最大ファイルサイズのしきい値を制御できます。この制限より大きいファイルは完全にスキップされます。

## 高度な機能

### コード圧縮

`output.compress: true`で有効になるコード圧縮機能は、[Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter)を使用して、実装の詳細を削除しながら本質的なコード構造を抽出します。これにより、重要な構造情報を維持しながらトークン数を削減できます。

主な利点：
- トークン数を大幅に削減
- クラスと関数のシグネチャを保持
- インポートとエクスポートを維持
- 型定義とインターフェースを保持
- 関数本体と実装の詳細を削除

詳細と例については[コード圧縮ガイド](code-compress)をご覧ください。

### Git統合

`output.git`設定では、以下のようなGit対応機能を提供します：

- `sortByChanges`: trueに設定すると、ファイルはGitの変更回数（そのファイルを変更したコミット数）でソートされます。変更が多いファイルが出力の下部に表示されます。これは、より活発に開発されているファイルを優先するのに役立ちます。デフォルト: `true`
- `sortByChangesMaxCommits`: ファイルの変更回数を数える際に分析する最大コミット数。デフォルト: `100`
- `includeDiffs`: trueに設定すると、Git差分を出力に含めます（ワークツリーとステージング済みの変更を別々に含みます）。これにより、リポジトリの保留中の変更を確認できます。デフォルト: `false`
- `includeLogs`: trueに設定すると、Gitログを出力に含めます。コミット履歴の日時、メッセージ、ファイルパスが表示され、AIがどのファイルが一緒に変更される傾向があるかを理解できます。デフォルト: `false`
- `includeLogsCount`: 含めるGitログのコミット数。開発パターンの分析に使用する履歴の深さを制御します。デフォルト: `50`

設定例：
```json
{
  "output": {
    "git": {
      "sortByChanges": true,
      "sortByChangesMaxCommits": 100,
      "includeDiffs": true,
      "includeLogs": true,
      "includeLogsCount": 30
    }
  }
}
```

### セキュリティチェック

`security.enableSecurityCheck`が有効な場合、Repomixは[Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint)を使用して、出力に含める前にコードベース内の機密情報を検出します。これにより、以下のような情報の誤った露出を防ぐことができます：

- APIキー
- アクセストークン
- 秘密鍵
- パスワード
- その他の機密情報

### コメントの削除

`output.removeComments`を`true`に設定すると、サポートされているファイルタイプからコメントが削除され、出力サイズを削減し、本質的なコード内容に焦点を当てることができます。これは以下のような場合に特に便利です：

- 大量にドキュメント化されたコードを扱う場合
- トークン数を削減したい場合
- コードの構造とロジックに集中したい場合

サポートされている言語と詳細な例については[コメント削除ガイド](comment-removal)をご覧ください。

## File: website/client/src/ja/guide/custom-instructions.md
`````markdown
# カスタム指示

Repomixでは、出力ファイルに含めるカスタム指示（独自の指示）を提供することができます。これは、AIシステムにプロジェクトの特定のコンテキストや要件を理解させるのに役立ちます。

## 使用方法

カスタム指示を含めるには、リポジトリのルートにマークダウンファイル（例：`repomix-instruction.md`）を作成し、`repomix.config.json`でそのパスを指定します。

```json
{
  "output": {
    "instructionFilePath": "repomix-instruction.md"
  }
}
```

このファイルの内容は出力の「Instruction」セクションに含まれます。

## 使用例

```markdown
# コーディングガイドライン

- Airbnb JavaScript スタイルガイドに従う
- 適切な場合は、ファイルを小さな単位に分割する
- 自明でないロジックにはコメントを追加。すべてのテキストは英語で記述
- すべての新機能には対応するユニットテストを作成する

# 生成内容について

- 特に指定がない限り、すべての内容を省略せずに含める
- 大規模なコードベースを処理しながら、出力の品質を維持する
```

これは出力ファイルで以下のように表示されます。

```xml
<instruction>
# コーディングガイドライン

- Airbnb JavaScript スタイルガイドに従う
- 適切な場合は、ファイルを小さな単位に分割する
- 自明でないロジックにはコメントを追加。すべてのテキストは英語で記述
- すべての新機能には対応するユニットテストを作成する

# 生成内容について

- 特に指定がない限り、すべての内容を省略せずに含める
- 大規模なコードベースを処理しながら、出力の品質を維持する
</instruction>
```

## 注意点

- カスタム指示は出力ファイルの`Instruction`セクションに含まれます。
- カスタム指示は適切な長さに保つことを推奨します。過度に長い指示は逆効果になる場合があります。
- プロジェクト固有のガイドラインや要件に焦点を当てることで、AIがプロジェクトのコンテキストを理解しやすくなり、より効果的な結果が得られます。

## File: website/client/src/ja/guide/mcp-server.md
`````markdown
# MCPサーバー

Repomixは[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)をサポートしており、AIアシスタントがコードベースと直接対話できるようになります。MCPサーバーとして実行すると、Repomixはローカルまたはリモートリポジトリを手動でファイル準備することなく、AI分析用にパッケージ化するツールを提供します。

> [!NOTE]  
> これは実験的な機能であり、ユーザーのフィードバックと実際の使用状況に基づいて積極的に改善を進めていきます

## RepomixをMCPサーバーとして実行する

RepomixをMCPサーバーとして実行するには、`--mcp`フラグを使用します：

```bash
repomix --mcp
```

これによりRepomixがMCPサーバーモードで起動し、Model Context ProtocolをサポートするAIアシスタントから利用できるようになります。

## MCPサーバーの設定

RepomixをMCPサーバーとしてClaudeなどのAIアシスタントで使用するには、MCP設定を構成する必要があります：

### VS Code向け

VS CodeにRepomix MCPサーバーをインストールするには、以下のいずれかの方法を使用します：

1. **インストールバッジを使用：**

  [![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-VS_Code?style=flat-square&label=Install%20Server&color=0098FF)](vscode:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22repomix%22%2C%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22repomix%22%2C%22--mcp%22%5D%7D)<br>
  [![Install in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-VS_Code_Insiders?style=flat-square&label=Install%20Server&color=24bfa5)](vscode-insiders:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22repomix%22%2C%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22repomix%22%2C%22--mcp%22%5D%7D)

2. **コマンドラインを使用：**

  ```bash
  code --add-mcp '{"name":"repomix","command":"npx","args":["-y","repomix","--mcp"]}'
  ```

  VS Code Insiders の場合：
  ```bash
  code-insiders --add-mcp '{"name":"repomix","command":"npx","args":["-y","repomix","--mcp"]}'
  ```

### Cline（VS Code拡張機能）の場合

`cline_mcp_settings.json`ファイルを編集します：

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "repomix": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "repomix",
        "--mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursorの場合

Cursorでは、`Cursor Settings` > `MCP` > `+ Add new global MCP server`からClineと同様の設定を追加します。

### Claude Desktopの場合

`claude_desktop_config.json`ファイルをClineの設定と同様に編集します。

### Claude Codeの場合

[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview)でRepomixをMCPサーバーとして設定するには、以下のコマンドを使用します：

```bash
claude mcp add repomix -- npx -y repomix --mcp
```

または、より便利な体験のために**公式Repomixプラグイン**を使用することもできます。プラグインは自然言語コマンドと簡単なセットアップを提供します。詳細は[Claude Codeプラグイン](/ja/guide/claude-code-plugins)のドキュメントをご覧ください。

### npxの代わりにDockerを使用

Dockerを使用してRepomixをMCPサーバーとして実行できます：

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "repomix-docker": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix",
        "--mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## 利用可能なMCPツール

MCPサーバーとして実行すると、Repomixは以下のツールを提供します：

### pack_codebase

このツールはローカルのコードディレクトリをAI分析用のXMLファイルにパッケージ化します。コードベース構造を分析し、関連するコード内容を抽出し、メトリクス、ファイルツリー、フォーマットされたコード内容を含む包括的なレポートを生成します。

**パラメータ：**
- `directory`: (必須) パッケージ化するディレクトリの絶対パス
- `compress`: (オプション、デフォルト: false) 実装の詳細を削除しながら、重要なコードシグネチャと構造を抽出するTree-sitter圧縮を有効にします。セマンティックな意味を保持しながらトークン使用量を約70%削減します。grep_repomix_outputが段階的なコンテンツ取得を可能にするため、通常は不要です。大きなリポジトリのコードベース全体の内容が特に必要な場合のみ使用してください。
- `includePatterns`: (オプション) fast-globパターンを使用して含めるファイルを指定します。複数のパターンはカンマ区切りで指定できます（例："**/*.{js,ts}", "src/**,docs/**"）。マッチするファイルのみが処理されます。
- `ignorePatterns`: (オプション) fast-globパターンを使用して除外する追加ファイルを指定します。複数のパターンはカンマ区切りで指定できます（例："test/**,*.spec.js", "node_modules/**,dist/**"）。これらのパターンは.gitignoreと組み込み除外を補完します。
- `topFilesLength`: (オプション、デフォルト: 10) コードベース分析のメトリクス要約に表示する最大ファイル数（サイズ順）。

**例：**
```json
{
  "directory": "/path/to/your/project",
  "compress": false,
  "includePatterns": "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md",
  "ignorePatterns": "**/*.log,tmp/",
  "topFilesLength": 10
}
```

### pack_remote_repository

このツールはGitHubリポジトリを取得、クローン、パッケージ化してAI分析用のXMLファイルを作成します。リモートリポジトリを自動的にクローンし、その構造を分析し、包括的なレポートを生成します。

**パラメータ：**
- `remote`: (必須) GitHubリポジトリURLまたはuser/repo形式（例："yamadashy/repomix", "https://github.com/user/repo", または "https://github.com/user/repo/tree/branch"）
- `compress`: (オプション、デフォルト: false) 実装の詳細を削除しながら、重要なコードシグネチャと構造を抽出するTree-sitter圧縮を有効にします。セマンティックな意味を保持しながらトークン使用量を約70%削減します。grep_repomix_outputが段階的なコンテンツ取得を可能にするため、通常は不要です。大きなリポジトリのコードベース全体の内容が特に必要な場合のみ使用してください。
- `includePatterns`: (オプション) fast-globパターンを使用して含めるファイルを指定します。複数のパターンはカンマ区切りで指定できます（例："**/*.{js,ts}", "src/**,docs/**"）。マッチするファイルのみが処理されます。
- `ignorePatterns`: (オプション) fast-globパターンを使用して除外する追加ファイルを指定します。複数のパターンはカンマ区切りで指定できます（例："test/**,*.spec.js", "node_modules/**,dist/**"）。これらのパターンは.gitignoreと組み込み除外を補完します。
- `topFilesLength`: (オプション、デフォルト: 10) コードベース分析のメトリクス要約に表示する最大ファイル数（サイズ順）。

**例：**
```json
{
  "remote": "yamadashy/repomix",
  "compress": false,
  "includePatterns": "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md",
  "ignorePatterns": "**/*.log,tmp/",
  "topFilesLength": 10
}
```

### read_repomix_output

このツールはRepomixで生成された出力ファイルの内容を読み込みます。大きなファイルに対する行範囲指定による部分読み込みをサポートします。このツールは直接ファイルシステムアクセスが制限された環境向けに設計されています。

**パラメータ：**
- `outputId`: (必須) 読み込むRepomix出力ファイルのID
- `startLine`: (オプション) 開始行番号（1ベース、包含）。指定しない場合は最初から読み込みます。
- `endLine`: (オプション) 終了行番号（1ベース、包含）。指定しない場合は最後まで読み込みます。

**機能：**
- ウェブベース環境やサンドボックスアプリケーション向けに特別に設計
- IDを使用して以前に生成された出力の内容を取得
- ファイルシステムアクセスを必要とせずにパッケージ化されたコードベースへの安全なアクセスを提供
- 大きなファイルの部分読み込みをサポート

**例：**
```json
{
  "outputId": "8f7d3b1e2a9c6054",
  "startLine": 100,
  "endLine": 200
}
```

### grep_repomix_output

このツールはJavaScript RegExp構文を使用したgrep風の機能でRepomix出力ファイル内のパターンを検索します。マッチした行の前後にオプションのコンテキスト行を含めて返します。

**パラメータ：**
- `outputId`: (必須) 検索するRepomix出力ファイルのID
- `pattern`: (必須) 検索パターン（JavaScript RegExp正規表現構文）
- `contextLines`: (オプション、デフォルト: 0) 各マッチの前後に表示するコンテキスト行数。beforeLines/afterLinesが指定された場合はそちらが優先されます。
- `beforeLines`: (オプション) 各マッチの前に表示するコンテキスト行数（grep -Bのように）。contextLinesより優先されます。
- `afterLines`: (オプション) 各マッチの後に表示するコンテキスト行数（grep -Aのように）。contextLinesより優先されます。
- `ignoreCase`: (オプション、デフォルト: false) 大文字小文字を区別しないマッチングを実行

**機能：**
- 強力なパターンマッチングのためのJavaScript RegExp構文を使用
- マッチの理解を深めるためのコンテキスト行をサポート
- before/afterコンテキスト行の個別制御が可能
- 大文字小文字を区別する/しない検索オプション

**例：**
```json
{
  "outputId": "8f7d3b1e2a9c6054",
  "pattern": "function\\s+\\w+\\(",
  "contextLines": 3,
  "ignoreCase": false
}
```

### file_system_read_file と file_system_read_directory

RepomixのMCPサーバーは、AIアシスタントがローカルファイルシステムと安全にやり取りするための2つのファイルシステムツールを提供しています：

1. `file_system_read_file`
  - 絶対パスを使用してローカルファイルシステムからファイルの内容を読み取り
  - 機密情報を含むファイルへのアクセスを検出・防止する組み込みセキュリティ検証を含む
  - [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint)を使用したセキュリティ検証を実装
  - 機密情報を含むファイル（APIキー、パスワード、シークレット）へのアクセスを防止
  - ディレクトリトラバーサル攻撃を防ぐための絶対パス検証
  - 無効なパスやセキュリティの問題に対する明確なエラーメッセージを返す

2. `file_system_read_directory`
  - 絶対パスを使用してディレクトリの内容を一覧表示
  - ファイルとサブディレクトリを明確な指標で示すフォーマット済みリストを返す
  - ファイルとディレクトリを明確な指標（`[FILE]`または`[DIR]`）で表示
  - 適切なエラー処理による安全なディレクトリ走査を提供
  - パスの検証と絶対パスの確認を実施
  - プロジェクト構造の探索とコードベース組織の理解に有用

両ツールは堅牢なセキュリティ対策を組み込んでいます：
- ディレクトリトラバーサル攻撃を防ぐための絶対パス検証
- 適切なアクセス権を確保するための権限チェック
- 機密情報検出のためのSecretlintとの統合
- デバッグとセキュリティ認識のための明確なエラーメッセージ

**例：**
```typescript
// ファイルの読み取り
const fileContent = await tools.file_system_read_file({
  path: '/absolute/path/to/file.txt'
});

// ディレクトリの内容一覧
const dirContent = await tools.file_system_read_directory({
  path: '/absolute/path/to/directory'
});
```

これらのツールは、AIアシスタントが以下のような操作を必要とする場合に特に有用です：
- コードベース内の特定のファイルを分析
- ディレクトリ構造をナビゲート
- ファイルの存在とアクセス可能性を確認
- 安全なファイルシステム操作を確保

## RepomixをMCPサーバーとして使用する利点

RepomixをMCPサーバーとして使用すると、いくつかの利点があります：

1. **直接統合**: AIアシスタントが手動でファイルを準備することなく、コードベースを直接分析できます。
2. **効率的なワークフロー**: ファイルを手動で生成してアップロードする必要がなくなり、コード分析のプロセスが効率化されます。
3. **一貫した出力**: AIアシスタントが一貫性のある最適化された形式でコードベースを受け取ることができます。
4. **高度な機能**: コード圧縮、トークンカウント、セキュリティチェックなど、Repomixのすべての機能を活用できます。

# 出力フォーマット

Repomixは4つの出力フォーマットをサポートしています。
- XML（デフォルト）
- Markdown
- JSON
- プレーンテキスト

## XMLフォーマット

```bash
repomix --style xml
```

XMLフォーマットはAI処理に最適化されています。

```xml
このファイルは、コードベース全体を1つのドキュメントにまとめた表現です...

```

### なぜXMLをデフォルト形式としているのか？

Repomixは広範な研究とテストに基づき、XMLをデフォルトの出力形式として採用しています。この決定は実証的な証拠とAIアシスト型コード解析における実用性を考慮した結果です。

XML採用の主な理由は、大手AIプロバイダーからの公式推奨事項にあります：
- **Anthropic (Claude)**: プロンプト構造化においてXMLタグの使用を明示的に推奨し、「Claudeは学習過程でそのようなプロンプトに触れている」と明記（[ドキュメント](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/use-xml-tags)）
- **Google (Gemini)**: 複雑なタスクにおいてXMLを含む構造化フォーマットを推奨（[ドキュメント](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/structure-prompts)）
- **OpenAI (GPT)**: 複雑なシナリオでの構造化プロンプトを推奨（[発表](https://x.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1890147300493914437)、[cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5_prompting_guide)）

## Markdownフォーマット

```bash
repomix --style markdown
```

Markdownは読みやすいフォーマットを提供します。

## JSONフォーマット

```bash
repomix --style json
```

JSONフォーマットは、camelCase形式のプロパティ名を使用した構造化され、プログラムでアクセス可能な出力を提供します。

```json
{
  "fileSummary": {
    "generationHeader": "このファイルは、Repomixによってコードベース全体を1つのドキュメントにまとめた表現です。",
    "purpose": "このファイルには、リポジトリ全体のコンテンツをパックした表現が含まれています...",
    "fileFormat": "コンテンツは以下のように構成されています...",
    "usageGuidelines": "- このファイルは読み取り専用として扱ってください...",
    "notes": "- 一部のファイルは.gitignoreルールに基づいて除外されている可能性があります..."
  },
  "userProvidedHeader": "指定された場合のカスタムヘッダーテキスト",
  "directoryStructure": "src/
  cli/
    cliOutput.ts
    index.ts
  config/
    configLoader.ts",
  "files": {
    "src/index.js": "// ファイルの内容がここに表示されます",
    "src/utils.js": "// ファイルの内容がここに表示されます"
  },
  "instruction": "instructionFilePathからのカスタム指示"
}
```

### JSONフォーマットの利点

JSONフォーマットは以下の用途に最適です：
- **プログラム処理**: 任意のプログラミング言語でJSONライブラリを使用して簡単に解析・操作が可能
- **API統合**: Webサービスやアプリケーションでのダイレクトな利用
- **AIツール互換性**: 機械学習やAIシステム向けに最適化された構造化フォーマット  
- **データ解析**: `jq`などのツールを使用した特定情報の簡単な抽出

### `jq`を使用したJSON出力の活用

JSONフォーマットによって、プログラムで特定の情報を簡単に抽出できます。一般的な使用例をご紹介します：

#### 基本的なファイル操作
```bash
# すべてのファイルパスを一覧表示
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[]'

# ファイル総数を取得
cat repomix-output.json | jq '.files | keys | length'

# 特定のファイル内容を抽出
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files["README.md"]'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files["src/index.js"]'
```

#### ファイルのフィルタリングと分析
```bash
# 拡張子でファイルを検索
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(endswith(".ts"))'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(endswith(".js") or endswith(".ts"))'

# 特定のテキストを含むファイルを検索
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | select(.value | contains("function")) | .key'

# ファイルリストと文字数を表示
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | "\(.key): \(.value | length) 文字"'
```

#### メタデータの抽出
```bash
# ディレクトリ構造を抽出
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.directoryStructure'

# ファイルサマリー情報を取得
cat repomix-output.json | jq '.fileSummary.purpose'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.fileSummary.generationHeader'

# ユーザー提供のヘッダーを抽出（存在する場合）
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.userProvidedHeader // "ヘッダーが提供されていません"'

# カスタム指示を取得
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.instruction // "指示が提供されていません"'
```

#### 高度な分析
```bash
# コンテンツ長で最大のファイルを検索
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | [.key, (.value | length)] | @tsv' | sort -k2 -nr | head -10

# 特定のパターンを含むファイルを検索
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | select(.value | test("import.*react"; "i")) | .key'

# 複数の拡張子にマッチするファイルパスを抽出
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(test("\.(js|ts|jsx|tsx)$"))'
```

# セキュリティ

## セキュリティチェック機能

Repomixは[Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint)を使用して、ファイル内の機密情報を検出します：
- APIキー
- アクセストークン
- 認証情報
- 秘密鍵
- 環境変数

## 設定

セキュリティチェックはデフォルトで有効になっています。

CLIで無効化する場合
```bash
repomix --no-security-check
```

または`repomix.config.json`で
```json
{
  "security": {
    "enableSecurityCheck": false
  }
}
```

## セキュリティ対策

1. **バイナリファイルの処理**: バイナリファイルの内容は出力から除外されますが、完全なリポジトリ概要のためにそのパスはディレクトリ構造にリストされます
2. **Git対応**: `.gitignore`パターンを尊重します
3. **自動検出**: 以下を含む一般的なセキュリティ問題を検出
    - AWSの認証情報
    - データベース接続文字列
    - 認証トークン
    - 秘密鍵

## セキュリティチェックで問題が見つかった場合

🔍 Security Check:
──────────────────
2 suspicious file(s) detected and excluded:
1. config/credentials.json
  - Found AWS access key
2. .env.local
  - Found database password
```

## ベストプラクティス

1. 共有する前に必ず出力を確認
2. `.repomixignore`を使用して機密性のあるパスを除外
3. セキュリティチェックを有効に保つ
4. 機密ファイルをリポジトリから削除

## セキュリティ問題の報告

`````

## File: website/client/src/ja/guide/usage.md
`````markdown
# 基本的な使い方

## クイックスタート

リポジトリ全体をパッケージ化：
```bash
repomix
```

## 一般的な使用例

### 特定のディレクトリをパッケージ化
```bash
repomix path/to/directory
```

### 特定のファイルを含める
[glob パターン](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax)を使用：
```bash
repomix --include "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md"
```

### ファイルを除外
```bash
repomix --ignore "**/*.log,tmp/"
```

### リモートリポジトリ
```bash
# GitHub URLを使用
repomix --remote https://github.com/user/repo

# ショートハンドを使用
repomix --remote user/repo

# 特定のブランチ/タグ/コミット
repomix --remote user/repo --remote-branch main
repomix --remote user/repo --remote-branch 935b695
```

### ファイルリスト入力（stdin）

究極の柔軟性でファイルパスをstdin経由で渡します：

```bash
# findコマンドを使用
find src -name "*.ts" -type f | repomix --stdin

# gitを使用してトラッキングされているファイルを取得
git ls-files "*.ts" | repomix --stdin

# ripgrep (rg) を使用してファイルを検索
rg --files --type ts | repomix --stdin

# grepを使用して特定の内容を含むファイルを検索
grep -l "TODO" **/*.ts | repomix --stdin

# ripgrepを使用して特定の内容を含むファイルを検索
rg -l "TODO|FIXME" --type ts | repomix --stdin

# sharkdp/fd を使用してファイルを検索
fd -e ts | repomix --stdin

# fzfを使用してすべてのファイルから選択
fzf -m | repomix --stdin

# fzfを使用したインタラクティブなファイル選択
find . -name "*.ts" -type f | fzf -m | repomix --stdin

# globパターンを使用したls
ls src/**/*.ts | repomix --stdin

# ファイルパスが含まれるファイルから
cat file-list.txt | repomix --stdin

# echoで直接入力
echo -e "src/index.ts\nsrc/utils.ts" | repomix --stdin
```

`--stdin`オプションを使用すると、Repomixにファイルパスのリストをパイプできるため、どのファイルをパッケージ化するかの選択において究極の柔軟性が得られます。

`--stdin`で指定されたファイルは、実質的にincludeパターンに追加されます。つまり、通常のincludeおよびignoreの動作と同じで、stdinで指定したファイルもignoreパターンに一致する場合は除外されます。

> [!NOTE]
> `--stdin`を使用する場合、ファイルパスは相対パスまたは絶対パスのどちらでも指定でき、Repomixが自動的にパス解決と重複除去を処理します。

### コード圧縮

```bash
repomix --compress

# リモートリポジトリでも使用可能：
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix --compress
```

### Git統合

AI分析のための開発コンテキストを提供するためにGit情報を含めます：

```bash
# Git差分を含める（コミットされていない変更）
repomix --include-diffs

# Gitコミットログを含める（デフォルトで最新50コミット）
repomix --include-logs

# 特定の数のコミットを含める
repomix --include-logs --include-logs-count 10

# 差分とログの両方を含める
repomix --include-diffs --include-logs
```

これにより以下の貴重なコンテキストが追加されます：
- **最近の変更**: Git差分はコミットされていない変更を表示
- **開発パターン**: Gitログは通常一緒に変更されるファイルを明らかにする
- **コミット履歴**: 最近のコミットメッセージは開発の焦点についての洞察を提供
- **ファイル関係**: 同じコミットで変更されるファイルの理解

### トークン数最適化

コードベースのトークン分布を理解することは、AIとの対話を最適化するために重要です。`--token-count-tree`オプションを使用して、プロジェクト全体のトークン使用量を視覚化できます：

```bash
repomix --token-count-tree
```

これにより、コードベースの階層ビューがトークン数とともに表示されます：

```
🔢 Token Count Tree:
────────────────────
└── src/ (70,925 tokens)
    ├── cli/ (12,714 tokens)
    │   ├── actions/ (7,546 tokens)
    │   └── reporters/ (990 tokens)
    └── core/ (41,600 tokens)
        ├── file/ (10,098 tokens)
        └── output/ (5,808 tokens)
```

最小トークン閾値を設定して、大きなファイルに焦点を当てることもできます：

```bash
repomix --token-count-tree 1000  # 1000以上のトークンを持つファイル/ディレクトリのみを表示
```

これにより以下のことが可能になります：
- **トークンの多いファイルを特定** - AIのコンテキスト制限を超える可能性があるファイルを発見
- **ファイル選択を最適化** - `--include`と`--ignore`パターンを使用した最適化
- **圧縮戦略を計画** - 最大の要因をターゲットにした戦略立案
- **コンテンツとコンテキストのバランス** - AI分析用のコード準備時のバランス調整

## 出力形式

### XML（デフォルト）
```bash
repomix --style xml
```

### Markdown
```bash
repomix --style markdown
```

### JSON
```bash
repomix --style json
```

### プレーンテキスト

### コメントを削除
```bash
repomix --remove-comments
```

### 行番号を表示
```bash
repomix --output-show-line-numbers
```

### クリップボードにコピー
```bash

# Repomix를 라이브러리로 사용하기

Repomix를 CLI 도구로 사용하는 것 외에도 Node.js 애플리케이션에 직접 기능을 통합할 수 있습니다.

## 설치

프로젝트에 Repomix를 의존성으로 설치하세요:

```bash
npm install repomix
```

## 기본 사용법

Repomix를 사용하는 가장 간단한 방법은 명령줄 인터페이스와 동일한 기능을 제공하는 `runCli` 함수를 통해 사용하는 것입니다:

```javascript
import { runCli, type CliOptions } from 'repomix';

// 사용자 정의 옵션으로 현재 디렉토리 처리
async function packProject() {
  const options = {
    output: 'output.xml',
    style: 'xml',
    compress: true,
    quiet: true
  } as CliOptions;
  
  const result = await runCli(['.'], process.cwd(), options);
  return result.packResult;
}
```

`result.packResult`에는 처리된 파일에 대한 다음 정보가 포함됩니다:
- `totalFiles`: 처리된 파일 수
- `totalCharacters`: 총 문자 수
- `totalTokens`: 총 토큰 수(LLM 컨텍스트 제한에 유용)
- `fileCharCounts`: 파일별 문자 수
- `fileTokenCounts`: 파일별 토큰 수

## 원격 저장소 처리

원격 저장소를 클론하고 처리할 수 있습니다:

```javascript
import { runCli, type CliOptions } from 'repomix';

// GitHub 저장소 클론 및 처리
async function processRemoteRepo(repoUrl) {
  const options = {
    remote: repoUrl,
    output: 'output.xml',
    compress: true
  } as CliOptions;
  
  return await runCli(['.'], process.cwd(), options);
}
```

## 핵심 컴포넌트 사용

더 많은 제어를 위해 Repomix의 저수준 API를 직접 사용할 수 있습니다:

```javascript
import { searchFiles, collectFiles, processFiles, TokenCounter } from 'repomix';

async function analyzeFiles(directory) {
  // 파일 찾기 및 수집
  const { filePaths } = await searchFiles(directory, { /* 설정 */ });
  const rawFiles = await collectFiles(filePaths, directory);
  const processedFiles = await processFiles(rawFiles, { /* 설정 */ });
  
  // 토큰 계산
  const tokenCounter = new TokenCounter('o200k_base');
  
  // 분석 결과 반환
  return processedFiles.map(file => ({
    path: file.path,
    tokens: tokenCounter.countTokens(file.content)
  }));
}
```

## 실제 사례

Repomix 웹사이트([repomix.com](https://repomix.com))는 원격 저장소를 처리하기 위해 라이브러리로 Repomix를 사용합니다. [website/server/src/remoteRepo.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/....ts)에서 구현을 확인할 수 있습니다.

# AI 지원 개발 모범 사례: 나의 경험으로부터

저는 아직 AI를 사용하여 대규모 프로젝트를 성공적으로 완료하지는 못했지만, 지금까지 개발 과정에서 AI와 함께 작업하면서 배운 점을 공유하고자 합니다.

## 기본 개발 접근 방식

AI와 함께 작업할 때, 모든 기능을 한 번에 구현하려고 하면 예상치 못한 문제와 프로젝트 정체로 이어질 수 있습니다. 그렇기 때문에 핵심 기능부터 시작하여 각 기능을 하나씩 구축하고, 다음 단계로 넘어가기 전에 견고한 구현을 보장하는 것이 더 효과적입니다.

### 기존 코드의 힘

이 접근 방식이 효과적인 이유는 핵심 기능을 구현하면 실제 코드를 통해 이상적인 설계와 코딩 스타일을 구체화할 수 있기 때문입니다. 프로젝트 비전을 전달하는 가장 효과적인 방법은 표준과 선호도를 반영하는 코드를 작성하는 것입니다.

핵심 기능부터 시작하여 각 구성 요소가 제대로 작동하는지 확인한 후 다음 단계로 진행하면 전체 프로젝트의 일관성이 유지되므로 AI가 더 적절한 코드를 생성하기 쉬워집니다.

## 모듈식 접근 방식

코드를 더 작은 모듈로 나누는 것이 중요합니다. 제 경험상, 파일을 약 250줄 정도로 유지하면 AI에게 명확한 지침을 제공하기 쉽고 시행착오 프로세스가 더 효율적입니다. 토큰 수가 더 정확한 지표가 될 수 있지만, 줄 수는 개발자가 작업하기에 더 실용적이므로 이를 지침으로 사용합니다.

이러한 모듈화는 단순히 프런트엔드, 백엔드, 데이터베이스 구성 요소를 분리하는 것뿐만 아니라 훨씬 더 세분화된 수준에서 기능을 분리하는 것입니다. 예를 들어, 단일 기능 내에서 유효성 검사, 오류 처리 및 기타 특정 기능을 별개의 모듈로 분리할 수 있습니다. 물론, 높은 수준의 분리도 중요하며, 이러한 모듈식 접근 방식을 점진적으로 구현하면 명확한 지침을 유지하고 AI가 더 적절한 코드를 생성할 수 있습니다. 이 접근 방식은 AI뿐만 아니라 사람 개발자에게도 효과적입니다.

## 테스트를 통한 품질 보장

저는 AI 지원 개발에서 테스트가 매우 중요하다고 생각합니다. 테스트는 품질 보장 수단일 뿐만 아니라 코드 의도를 명확하게 보여주는 문서 역할도 합니다. AI에게 새로운 기능 구현을 요청할 때, 기존 테스트 코드는 사실상 사양 문서 역할을 합니다.

테스트는 또한 AI가 생성한 코드의 정확성을 검증하는 훌륭한 도구입니다. 예를 들어, AI에게 모듈에 대한 새로운 기능 구현을 요청할 때, 테스트 케이스를 미리 작성하면 생성된 코드가 예상대로 작동하는지 객관적으로 평가할 수 있습니다. 이는 테스트 주도 개발(TDD) 원칙과 잘 부합하며 AI와 협업할 때 특히 효과적입니다.

## 계획과 구현의 균형

대규모 기능을 구현하기 전에 먼저 AI와 계획에 대해 논의하는 것이 좋습니다. 요구 사항을 정리하고 아키텍처를 고려하면 구현이 더 원활해집니다. 좋은 방법은 먼저 요구 사항을 정리한 다음 별도의 대화 세션으로 이동하여 구현 작업을 수행하는 것입니다.

AI의 출력을 사람이 검토하고 필요에 따라 조정하는 것이 중요합니다. AI가 생성한 코드의 품질은 일반적으로 보통 수준이지만, 모든 것을 처음부터 작성하는 것보다 개발 속도를 높여줍니다.

## 결론

이러한 관행을 따르면 AI의 강점을 활용하면서 일관성 있고 고품질의 코드베이스를 구축할 수 있습니다. 프로젝트 규모가 커지더라도 각 구성 요소는 잘 정의되고 관리하기 쉬운 상태로 유지됩니다.

# Agent Skills 생성

Repomix는 [Claude Agent Skills](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) 형식의 출력을 생성하여 AI 어시스턴트의 재사용 가능한 코드베이스 참조로 사용할 수 있는 구조화된 Skills 디렉토리를 생성할 수 있습니다.

이 기능은 특히 원격 저장소의 구현을 참조하고 싶을 때 강력한 힘을 발휘합니다. 오픈소스 프로젝트에서 Skills를 생성하면 자신의 코드를 작성하면서 Claude에게 특정 패턴이나 구현을 참조하도록 쉽게 요청할 수 있습니다.

단일 패키지 파일을 생성하는 대신, Skills 생성은 AI 이해와 grep 친화적인 검색에 최적화된 여러 참조 파일을 포함하는 구조화된 디렉토리를 생성합니다.

> [!NOTE]
> 이것은 실험적인 기능입니다. 출력 형식과 옵션은 사용자 피드백에 따라 향후 릴리스에서 변경될 수 있습니다.

## 기본 사용법

로컬 디렉토리에서 Skills 생성:

```bash
# 현재 디렉토리에서 Skills 생성
repomix --skill-generate

# 사용자 정의 Skills 이름으로 생성
repomix --skill-generate my-project-reference

# 특정 디렉토리에서 생성
repomix path/to/directory --skill-generate

# 원격 저장소에서 생성
repomix --remote https://github.com/user/repo --skill-generate
```

## Skills 저장 위치 선택

명령을 실행하면 Repomix가 Skills 저장 위치를 선택하도록 요청합니다:

1. **Personal Skills** (`~/.claude/skills/`) - 머신의 모든 프로젝트에서 사용 가능
2. **Project Skills** (`.claude/skills/`) - git을 통해 팀과 공유

Skills 디렉토리가 이미 존재하면 덮어쓰기 확인 메시지가 표시됩니다.

> [!TIP]
> Project Skills를 생성할 때는 대용량 파일의 커밋을 피하기 위해 `.gitignore`에 추가하는 것을 고려하세요:
> ```gitignore
> .claude/skills/repomix-reference-*/
> ```

## 생성되는 구조

Skills는 다음 구조로 생성됩니다:

```text
.claude/skills/<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md                    # 메인 Skills 메타데이터 및 문서

# 파일 필터링과 함께 Skills 생성
repomix --skill-generate --include "src/**/*.ts" --ignore "**/*.test.ts"

# 압축과 함께 Skills 생성
repomix --skill-generate --compress

# 원격 저장소에서 Skills 생성
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix --skill-generate

# 특정 출력 형식 옵션과 함께 Skills 생성
repomix --skill-generate --remove-comments --remove-empty-lines
```

### 문서 전용 Skills

`--include`를 사용하면 GitHub 저장소의 문서만 포함된 Skills를 생성할 수 있습니다. 코드를 작성하면서 Claude가 특정 라이브러리나 프레임워크 문서를 참조하도록 할 때 유용합니다:

```bash
# Claude Code Action 문서
repomix --remote https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action --include docs --skill-generate

# Vite 문서
repomix --remote https://github.com/vitejs/vite --include docs --skill-generate

# React 문서
repomix --remote https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev --include src/content --skill-generate
```

## 제한 사항

`--skill-generate` 옵션은 다음과 함께 사용할 수 없습니다:
- `--stdout` - Skills 출력은 파일 시스템에 쓰기가 필요함
- `--copy` - Skills 출력은 디렉토리이므로 클립보드에 복사할 수 없음

## 생성된 Skills 사용

생성 후 Claude에서 Skills를 사용할 수 있습니다:

1. **Claude Code**: `~/.claude/skills/` 또는 `.claude/skills/`에 저장되면 자동으로 사용 가능
2. **Claude Web**: 코드베이스 분석을 위해 Skills 디렉토리를 Claude에 업로드
3. **팀 공유**: 팀 전체 액세스를 위해 `.claude/skills/`를 저장소에 커밋

## 예제 워크플로우

### 개인 참조 라이브러리 만들기

```bash
# 흥미로운 오픈소스 프로젝트를 클론하고 분석
repomix --remote facebook/react --skill-generate react-reference

# Skills가 ~/.claude/skills/react-reference/에 저장됨
# 이제 모든 Claude 대화에서 React 코드베이스를 참조할 수 있음
```

### 팀 프로젝트 문서화

```bash
# 프로젝트 디렉토리에서
cd my-project

# 팀을 위한 Skills 생성
repomix --skill-generate

# 프롬프트에서 "Project Skills" 선택
# Skills가 .claude/skills/repomix-reference-my-project/에 저장됨

# 커밋하고 팀과 공유
git add .claude/skills/
git commit -m "Add codebase reference Skills"
```

# 코드 압축

코드 압축은 구현 세부 사항을 제거하면서 필수적인 코드 구조를 지능적으로 추출하는 강력한 기능입니다. 이는 코드베이스의 중요한 구조적 정보를 유지하면서 토큰 수를 줄일 때 특히 유용합니다.

> [!NOTE]
> 이것은 실험적인 기능으로, 사용자 피드백과 실제 사용 사례를 바탕으로 지속적으로 개선될 예정입니다.

## 기본 사용법

`--compress` 플래그를 사용하여 코드 압축을 활성화합니다:

```bash
repomix --compress
```

원격 저장소에서도 사용할 수 있습니다:

```bash
repomix --remote user/repo --compress
```

## 작동 방식

압축 알고리즘은 Tree-sitter 파싱을 사용하여 코드를 처리하고, 구현 세부 사항을 제거하면서 필수적인 구조적 요소를 추출하고 보존합니다.

압축 시 유지되는 요소:
- 함수와 메서드 시그니처
- 인터페이스와 타입 정의
- 클래스 구조와 속성
- 중요한 구조적 요소

제거되는 요소:
- 함수와 메서드 구현
- 반복문과 조건문 로직 세부 사항
- 내부 변수 선언
- 구현 관련 코드

### 예시

원본 TypeScript 코드:

```typescript
import { ShoppingItem } from './shopping-item';

/**
 * Calculate the total price of shopping items
 */
const calculateTotal = (
  items: ShoppingItem[]
) => {
  let total = 0;
  for (const item of items) {
    total += item.price * item.quantity;
  }
  return total;
}

// Shopping item interface
interface Item {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  quantity: number;
}
```

압축 후:

```typescript
import { ShoppingItem } from './shopping-item';
⋮----
/**
 * Calculate the total price of shopping items
 */
const calculateTotal = (
  items: ShoppingItem[]
) => {
⋮----
// Shopping item interface
interface Item {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  quantity: number;
}
```

## 설정

설정 파일에서 압축을 활성화할 수 있습니다:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "compress": true
  }
}
```

## 사용 사례

코드 압축은 다음과 같은 경우에 특히 유용합니다:
- 코드 구조와 아키텍처 분석
- LLM 처리를 위한 토큰 수 감소
- 고수준 문서 작성
- 코드 패턴과 시그니처 이해
- API와 인터페이스 설계 공유

## 관련 옵션

압축은 다음 옵션들과 함께 사용할 수 있습니다:
- `--remove-comments`: 코드 주석 제거
- `--remove-empty-lines`: 빈 줄 제거
- `--output-show-line-numbers`: 출력에 줄 번호 추가

## File: website/client/src/ko/guide/comment-removal.md
`````markdown
# 주석 제거

Repomix는 출력 파일을 생성할 때 코드베이스에서 주석을 자동으로 제거할 수 있습니다. 이를 통해 노이즈를 줄이고 실제 코드에 집중할 수 있습니다.

## 사용법

주석 제거를 활성화하려면 `repomix.config.json`에서 `removeComments` 옵션을 `true`로 설정합니다.

```json
{
  "output": {
    "removeComments": true
  }
}
```

## 지원되는 언어

Repomix는 다음을 포함한 광범위한 프로그래밍 언어에 대한 주석 제거를 지원합니다.

- JavaScript/TypeScript (`//`, `/* */`)
- Python (`#`, `"""`, `'''`)
- Java (`//`, `/* */`)
- C/C++ (`//`, `/* */`)
- HTML (`<!-- -->`)
- CSS (`/* */`)
- 그리고 더 많은 언어들...

## 예시

다음 JavaScript 코드가 주어졌을 때:

```javascript
// 이것은 한 줄 주석입니다
function test() {
  /* 이것은
     여러 줄 주석입니다 */
  return true;
}
```

주석 제거를 활성화하면 출력은 다음과 같습니다.

```javascript
function test() {
  return true;
}
```

## 참고

- 주석 제거는 행 번호 추가와 같은 다른 처리 단계 전에 수행됩니다.
- JSDoc 주석과 같은 일부 주석은 언어 및 컨텍스트에 따라 보존될 수 있습니다.

# 설정

Repomix는 설정 파일 또는 명령줄 옵션을 사용하여 설정할 수 있습니다. 설정 파일을 사용하면 코드베이스의 처리 및 출력 방식을 사용자 정의할 수 있습니다.

## 설정 파일 형식

Repomix는 유연성과 사용 편의성을 위해 여러 설정 파일 형식을 지원합니다.

Repomix는 다음 우선순위 순서로 설정 파일을 자동으로 검색합니다:

1. **TypeScript** (`repomix.config.ts`, `repomix.config.mts`, `repomix.config.cts`)
2. **JavaScript/ES Module** (`repomix.config.js`, `repomix.config.mjs`, `repomix.config.cjs`)
3. **JSON** (`repomix.config.json5`, `repomix.config.jsonc`, `repomix.config.json`)

### JSON 설정

프로젝트 디렉토리에 설정 파일을 생성합니다:
```bash
repomix --init
```

이렇게 하면 기본 설정이 포함된 `repomix.config.json` 파일이 생성됩니다. 로컬 설정이 없을 때 대체로 사용될 전역 설정 파일을 생성할 수도 있습니다:

```bash
repomix --init --global
```

### TypeScript 설정

TypeScript 설정 파일은 완전한 타입 검사 및 IDE 지원으로 최고의 개발자 경험을 제공합니다.

**설치:**

`defineConfig`와 함께 TypeScript 또는 JavaScript 설정을 사용하려면 Repomix를 dev dependency로 설치해야 합니다:

```bash
npm install -D repomix
```

**예제:**

```typescript
// repomix.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'repomix';

export default defineConfig({
  output: {
    filePath: 'output.xml',
    style: 'xml',
    removeComments: true,
  },
  ignore: {
    customPatterns: ['**/node_modules/**', '**/dist/**'],
  },
});
```

**장점:**
- ✅ IDE에서 완전한 TypeScript 타입 검사
- ✅ 탁월한 IDE 자동 완성 및 IntelliSense
- ✅ 동적 값 사용 가능 (타임스탬프, 환경 변수 등)

**동적 값 예제:**

```typescript
// repomix.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'repomix';

// 타임스탬프 기반 파일명 생성
const timestamp = new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 19).replace(/[:.]/g, '-');

export default defineConfig({
  output: {
    filePath: `output-${timestamp}.xml`,
    style: 'xml',
  },
});
```

### JavaScript 설정

JavaScript 설정 파일은 TypeScript와 동일하게 작동하며 `defineConfig` 및 동적 값을 지원합니다.

설정 파일은 [JSON5](https://json5.org/) 구문을 지원하며, 다음을 허용합니다:
- 주석(한 줄 및 여러 줄)
- 객체와 배열의 후행 쉼표
- 따옴표 없는 속성 이름
- 더 유연한 문자열 구문

## 스키마 유효성 검사

`$schema` 속성을 추가하여 설정 파일에 대한 스키마 유효성 검사를 활성화할 수 있습니다:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://repomix.com/schemas/latest/schema.json",
  "output": {
    "filePath": "repomix-output.md",
    "style": "markdown"
  }
}
```

이렇게 하면 JSON 스키마를 지원하는 편집기에서 자동 완성 및 유효성 검사 기능을 제공합니다.

## 설정 파일 예시

다음은 전체 설정 파일(`repomix.config.json`)의 예시입니다:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://repomix.com/schemas/latest/schema.json",
  "input": {
    "maxFileSize": 50000000
  },
  "output": {
    "filePath": "repomix-output.xml",
    "style": "xml",
    "parsableStyle": false,
    "compress": false,
    "headerText": "패키지된 파일의 사용자 정의 헤더 정보",
    "fileSummary": true,
    "directoryStructure": true,
    "files": true,
    "removeComments": false,
    "removeEmptyLines": false,
    "topFilesLength": 5,

}
```

## 설정 파일 위치

Repomix는 다음 순서로 설정 파일을 찾습니다:
1. 현재 디렉토리의 로컬 설정 파일 (우선순위: TS > JS > JSON)
   - TypeScript: `repomix.config.ts`, `repomix.config.mts`, `repomix.config.cts`
   - JavaScript: `repomix.config.js`, `repomix.config.mjs`, `repomix.config.cjs`
   - JSON: `repomix.config.json5`, `repomix.config.jsonc`, `repomix.config.json`
2. 전역 설정 파일 (우선순위: TS > JS > JSON)
   - Windows:
     - TypeScript: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.ts`, `.mts`, `.cts`
     - JavaScript: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`
     - JSON: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.json5`, `.jsonc`, `.json`
   - macOS/Linux:
     - TypeScript: `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.ts`, `.mts`, `.cts`
     - JavaScript: `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`
     - JSON: `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.json5`, `.jsonc`, `.json`

명령줄 옵션은 설정 파일의 설정보다 우선합니다.

## 포함 패턴

Repomix는 [glob 패턴](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax)을 사용하여 포함할 파일을 지정할 수 있습니다. 이를 통해 더욱 유연하고 강력한 파일 선택이 가능합니다:

- `**/*.js`를 사용하여 모든 디렉토리의 모든 JavaScript 파일 포함
- `src/**/*`를 사용하여 `src` 디렉토리와 하위 디렉토리 내의 모든 파일 포함
- `["src/**/*.js", "**/*.md"]`와 같이 여러 패턴을 결합하여 `src`의 JavaScript 파일과 모든 Markdown 파일 포함

설정 파일에서 포함 패턴을 지정할 수 있습니다:

```json
{
  "include": ["src/**/*", "tests/**/*.test.js"]
}
```

또는 일회성 필터링을 위해 `--include` 명령줄 옵션을 사용합니다.

## 무시 패턴

Repomix는 패키징 프로세스 중에 특정 파일이나 디렉토리를 제외하기 위한 여러 방법을 제공합니다:

- **.gitignore**: 기본적으로 프로젝트의 `.gitignore` 파일과 `.git/info/exclude`에 나열된 패턴이 사용됩니다. 이 동작은 `ignore.useGitignore` 설정 또는 `--no-gitignore` CLI 옵션으로 제어할 수 있습니다.
- **.ignore**: 프로젝트 루트에 `.gitignore`와 동일한 형식의 `.ignore` 파일을 사용할 수 있습니다. 이 파일은 ripgrep 및 the silver searcher와 같은 도구에서도 사용되어 여러 무시 파일을 관리할 필요성을 줄입니다. 이 동작은 `ignore.useDotIgnore` 설정 또는 `--no-dot-ignore` CLI 옵션으로 제어할 수 있습니다.
- **기본 패턴**: Repomix에는 일반적으로 제외되는 파일 및 디렉토리의 기본 목록(예: node_modules, .git, 바이너리 파일)이 포함되어 있습니다. 이 기능은 `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` 설정 또는 `--no-default-patterns` CLI 옵션으로 제어할 수 있습니다. 자세한 내용은 [defaultIgnore.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/src/config/defaultIgnore.ts)를 참조하세요.
- **.repomixignore**: 프로젝트 루트에 `.repomixignore` 파일을 생성하여 Repomix 전용 무시 패턴을 정의할 수 있습니다. 이 파일은 `.gitignore`와 동일한 형식을 따릅니다.
- **사용자 정의 패턴**: 설정 파일의 `ignore.customPatterns` 옵션을 사용하여 추가 무시 패턴을 지정할 수 있습니다. 이 설정은 `-i, --ignore` 명령줄 옵션으로 덮어쓸 수 있습니다.

**우선순위** (높은 순서에서 낮은 순서):

1. 사용자 정의 패턴(`ignore.customPatterns`)
2. 무시 파일(`.repomixignore`, `.ignore`, `.gitignore`, `.git/info/exclude`):
   - 중첩된 디렉터리에 있는 경우, 더 깊은 디렉터리의 파일이 더 높은 우선순위를 가집니다
   - 같은 디렉터리에 있는 경우, 이러한 파일들은 특정 순서 없이 병합됩니다
3. 기본 패턴(`ignore.useDefaultPatterns`가 true이고 `--no-default-patterns`가 사용되지 않은 경우)

이 접근 방식을 통해 프로젝트의 필요에 따라 유연한 파일 제외 설정이 가능합니다. 보안에 민감한 파일과 대용량 바이너리 파일의 제외를 보장하면서 기밀 정보 유출을 방지하여 생성된 팩 파일의 크기를 최적화하는 데 도움이 됩니다.

**참고:** 바이너리 파일은 기본적으로 패킹된 출력에 포함되지 않지만, 해당 경로는 출력 파일의 "저장소 구조" 섹션에 나열됩니다. 이를 통해 팩 파일을 효율적이고 텍스트 기반으로 유지하면서 저장소 구조의 전체 개요를 제공합니다. 자세한 내용은 [바이너리 파일 처리](#바이너리-파일-처리)를 참조하세요.

`.repomixignore` 예시:
```text
# 캐시 디렉토리
.cache/
tmp/

# 빌드 출력
dist/
build/

# 로그
*.log
```

## 기본 무시 패턴

`ignore.useDefaultPatterns`가 true일 때 Repomix는 다음과 같은 일반적인 패턴을 자동으로 무시합니다:
```text
node_modules/**
.git/**
coverage/**
dist/**
```

전체 목록은 [defaultIgnore.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/src/config/defaultIgnore.ts)를 참조하세요.

## 바이너리 파일 처리

바이너리 파일(이미지, PDF, 컴파일된 바이너리, 아카이브 등)은 효율적인 텍스트 기반 출력을 유지하기 위해 특별하게 처리됩니다:

- **파일 내용**: 바이너리 파일은 파일을 텍스트 기반으로 유지하고 AI 처리에 효율적으로 만들기 위해 패킹된 출력에 **포함되지 않습니다**
- **디렉토리 구조**: 바이너리 파일 **경로는 나열되며** 디렉토리 구조 섹션에 표시되어 저장소의 완전한 개요를 제공합니다

이 접근 방식은 AI 소비에 최적화된 효율적인 텍스트 기반 출력을 유지하면서 저장소 구조의 완전한 보기를 얻을 수 있도록 보장합니다.

**예시:**

저장소에 `logo.png`와 `app.jar`가 포함된 경우:
- 디렉토리 구조 섹션에 표시됩니다
- 해당 내용은 파일 섹션에 포함되지 않습니다

**디렉토리 구조 출력:**
```
src/
  index.ts
  utils.ts
assets/
  logo.png
build/
  app.jar
```

이렇게 하면 AI 도구가 바이너리 내용을 처리하지 않고도 프로젝트 구조에 이러한 바이너리 파일이 존재함을 이해할 수 있습니다.

**참고:** `input.maxFileSize` 설정 옵션(기본값: 50MB)을 사용하여 최대 파일 크기 임계값을 제어할 수 있습니다. 이 제한보다 큰 파일은 완전히 건너뜁니다.

## 고급 기능

### 코드 압축

코드 압축 기능(`output.compress: true`로 활성화)은 [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter)를 사용하여 구현 세부 사항을 제거하면서 필수 코드 구조를 지능적으로 추출합니다. 이는 중요한 구조 정보를 유지하면서 토큰 수를 줄이는 데 도움이 됩니다.

주요 이점:
- 토큰 수를 크게 줄임
- 클래스와 함수 시그니처 유지
- 임포트와 익스포트 유지
- 타입 정의와 인터페이스 유지
- 함수 본문과 구현 세부 사항 제거

자세한 정보와 예시는 [코드 압축 가이드](code-compress)를 참조하세요.

### Git 통합

`output.git` 설정은 강력한 Git 인식 기능을 제공합니다:

- `sortByChanges`: true로 설정하면 파일이 Git 변경 횟수(해당 파일을 수정한 커밋 수)로 정렬됩니다. 변경이 많은 파일이 출력 하단에 나타납니다. 이는 더 활발하게 개발되는 파일을 우선시하는 데 도움이 됩니다. 기본값: `true`
- `sortByChangesMaxCommits`: 파일 변경 횟수를 계산할 때 분석할 최대 커밋 수. 기본값: `100`
- `includeDiffs`: true로 설정하면 Git 차이를 출력에 포함합니다(작업 트리와 스테이징된 변경 사항을 별도로 포함). 이를 통해 독자는 저장소의 대기 중인 변경 사항을 볼 수 있습니다. 기본값: `false`
- `includeLogs`: true로 설정하면 Git 로그를 출력에 포함합니다. 커밋 히스토리의 날짜, 메시지, 파일 경로가 표시되어 AI가 어떤 파일들이 일반적으로 함께 변경되는지 이해할 수 있습니다. 기본값: `false`
- `includeLogsCount`: 포함할 Git 로그 커밋 수입니다. 개발 패턴 분석에 사용되는 히스토리 깊이를 제어합니다. 기본값: `50`

설정 예시:
```json
{
  "output": {
    "git": {
      "sortByChanges": true,
      "sortByChangesMaxCommits": 100,
      "includeDiffs": true,
      "includeLogs": true,
      "includeLogsCount": 30
    }
  }
}
```

### 보안 검사

`security.enableSecurityCheck`가 활성화되면 Repomix는 [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint)를 사용하여 코드베이스를 출력에 포함하기 전에 민감한 정보를 감지합니다. 이는 다음과 같은 정보의 우발적 노출을 방지하는 데 도움이 됩니다:

- API 키
- 액세스 토큰
- 개인 키
- 비밀번호
- 기타 민감한 자격 증명

### 주석 제거

`output.removeComments`를 `true`로 설정하면 지원되는 파일 유형에서 주석이 제거되어 출력 크기를 줄이고 핵심 코드 내용에 집중할 수 있습니다. 이는 다음과 같은 경우에 특히 유용합니다:

- 많은 문서화가 된 코드 처리
- 토큰 수 줄이기 시도
- 코드 구조와 로직에 집중

지원되는 언어와 자세한 예시는 [주석 제거 가이드](comment-removal)를 참조하세요.

# 사용자 정의 지시사항

Repomix는 출력 파일에 포함될 사용자 정의 지시사항을 제공할 수 있게 해줍니다. 이는 AI 시스템이 프로젝트의 특정 맥락이나 요구 사항을 이해하는 데 도움이 됩니다.

## 사용법

사용자 정의 지시사항을 포함하려면 저장소의 루트에 마크다운 파일(예: `repomix-instruction.md`)을 생성하고, `repomix.config.json`에서 해당 파일의 경로를 지정하세요:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "instructionFilePath": "repomix-instruction.md"
  }
}
```

이 파일의 내용은 출력의 "Instruction" 섹션에 포함됩니다.

## 사용 예시

```markdown
# 코딩 지침

- Airbnb JavaScript 스타일 가이드를 따르세요.
- 필요한 경우 파일을 더 작은 단위로 분할하세요.
- 불분명한 로직에는 주석을 추가하세요. 모든 텍스트는 영어로 작성하세요.
- 모든 새로운 기능에 대해 해당 단위 테스트를 작성하세요.

## 생성된 콘텐츠에 대하여

- 특별한 지정이 없는 한, 모든 콘텐츠를 생략 없이 포함하세요.
- 대규모 코드베이스를 처리할 때도 출력 품질을 유지하세요.
```

이는 출력 파일에서 다음과 같이 표시됩니다:

```xml
<instruction>
# 코딩 가이드라인

- Airbnb JavaScript 스타일 가이드를 따릅니다
- 필요한 경우 파일을 작은 단위로 분할합니다
- 명확하지 않은 로직에는 주석을 추가합니다. 모든 텍스트는 영어로 작성합니다
- 모든 새로운 기능에는 해당하는 단위 테스트를 작성합니다

## 생성 내용에 대해

- 특별한 지정이 없는 한, 모든 내용은 축약하지 않고 포함합니다
- 대규모 코드베이스를 처리하면서도 출력의 품질을 유지합니다
</instruction>
```

## 모범 사례

1. **간결하고 명확하게**: 지시사항은 간결하되, 필요한 세부 사항은 모두 포함해야 합니다.
2. **구체적인 예시 제공**: 적절한 경우 코드 예시를 사용하여 설명을 보완합니다.
3. **우선순위 설정**: 가장 중요한 지시사항을 문서 앞부분에 배치하여 강조합니다.
4. **맥락 포함**: 프로젝트의 배경과 중요한 고려사항을 제공하여 AI가 작업을 더 잘 이해하도록 돕습니다.
5. **구조화된 콘텐츠**: 제목과 목록을 사용하여 지시사항을 체계적으로 구성하고 가독성을 높입니다.

## 주의 사항

- 지시사항에 민감한 정보를 포함하지 마세요
- 프로젝트의 변화를 반영하여 정기적으로 지시사항을 업데이트하세요
- 지시사항이 프로젝트의 다른 문서와 일관성을 유지하도록 하세요
- 명확한 계층 구조를 사용하여 콘텐츠를 구성하세요

# GitHub Actions에서 Repomix 사용하기

GitHub Actions 워크플로우에 Repomix를 통합하면 AI 분석을 위한 코드베이스 패킹을 자동화할 수 있습니다. 이는 CI, 코드 리뷰, LLM 도구 준비 등에 유용합니다.

## 기본 사용법

다음 스텝을 워크플로우 YAML에 추가하여 저장소를 패킹할 수 있습니다.

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    output: repomix-output.xml
```

## 다양한 출력 형식 사용하기

`style` 매개변수를 사용하여 다양한 출력 형식을 지정할 수 있습니다(기본값은 `xml`):

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    output: repomix-output.md
    style: markdown
```

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix (JSON format)
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    output: repomix-output.json
    style: json
```

## 여러 디렉터리 및 압축 옵션

여러 디렉터리, include/exclude 패턴, 스마트 압축도 지정할 수 있습니다.

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    directories: src tests
    include: "**/*.ts,**/*.md"
    ignore: "**/*.test.ts"
    output: repomix-output.txt
    compress: true
```

## 출력 파일을 아티팩트로 업로드

생성된 파일을 후속 스텝이나 다운로드용으로 업로드하는 예시입니다.

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    directories: src
    output: repomix-output.xml
    compress: true

# MCP 서버

Repomix는 [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)를 지원하며, AI 어시스턴트가 코드베이스와 직접 상호작용할 수 있게 해줍니다. MCP 서버로 실행하면 Repomix는 AI 어시스턴트가 수동 파일 준비 없이 로컬 또는 원격 저장소를 분석용으로 패키징할 수 있는 도구를 제공합니다.

> [!NOTE]  
> 이것은 실험적인 기능으로, 사용자 피드백과 실제 사용 사례를 바탕으로 지속적으로 개선해 나갈 예정입니다

## Repomix를 MCP 서버로 실행하기

Repomix를 MCP 서버로 실행하려면 `--mcp` 플래그를 사용하세요:

```bash
repomix --mcp
```

이렇게 하면 Repomix가 MCP 서버 모드로 시작되어 Model Context Protocol을 지원하는 AI 어시스턴트에서 사용할 수 있게 됩니다.

## MCP 서버 구성하기

Claude와 같은 AI 어시스턴트와 함께 Repomix를 MCP 서버로 사용하려면 MCP 설정을 구성해야 합니다:

### VS Code의 경우

VS Code에 Repomix MCP 서버를 설치하는 방법은 다음과 같습니다:

1. **설치 배지 사용:**

  [![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-VS_Code?style=flat-square&label=Install%20Server&color=0098FF)](vscode:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22repomix%22%2C%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22repomix%22%2C%22--mcp%22%5D%7D)<br>
  [![Install in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-VS_Code_Insiders?style=flat-square&label=Install%20Server&color=24bfa5)](vscode-insiders:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22repomix%22%2C%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22repomix%22%2C%22--mcp%22%5D%7D)

2. **명령줄 사용:**

  ```bash
  code --add-mcp '{"name":"repomix","command":"npx","args":["-y","repomix","--mcp"]}'
  ```

  VS Code Insiders의 경우:
  ```bash
  code-insiders --add-mcp '{"name":"repomix","command":"npx","args":["-y","repomix","--mcp"]}'
  ```

### Cline(VS Code 확장)의 경우

`cline_mcp_settings.json` 파일을 편집하세요:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "repomix": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "repomix",
        "--mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor의 경우

Cursor에서는 `Cursor Settings` > `MCP` > `+ Add new global MCP server`에서 Cline과 유사한 설정을 추가하세요.

### Claude Desktop의 경우

Cline의 구성과 유사하게 `claude_desktop_config.json` 파일을 편집하세요.

### Claude Code의 경우

[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview)에서 Repomix를 MCP 서버로 구성하려면 다음 명령어를 사용하세요:

```bash
claude mcp add repomix -- npx -y repomix --mcp
```

또는 더 편리한 경험을 위해 **공식 Repomix 플러그인**을 사용할 수 있습니다. 플러그인은 자연어 명령과 더 쉬운 설정을 제공합니다. 자세한 내용은 [Claude Code 플러그인](/ko/guide/claude-code-plugins) 문서를 참조하세요.

### npx 대신 Docker 사용

npx 대신 Docker를 사용하여 Repomix를 MCP 서버로 실행할 수 있습니다:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "repomix-docker": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix",
        "--mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## 사용 가능한 MCP 도구

MCP 서버로 실행할 때 Repomix는 다음 도구를 제공합니다:

### pack_codebase

이 도구는 로컬 코드 디렉토리를 AI 분석용 XML 파일로 패키징합니다. 코드베이스 구조를 분석하고 관련 코드 내용을 추출하여 메트릭, 파일 트리, 포맷된 코드 내용을 포함한 포괄적인 보고서를 생성합니다.

**매개변수:**
- `directory`: (필수) 패키징할 디렉토리의 절대 경로
- `compress`: (선택, 기본값: false) 구현 세부사항을 제거하면서 필수 코드 시그니처와 구조를 추출하는 Tree-sitter 압축을 활성화합니다. 의미론적 의미를 유지하면서 토큰 사용량을 ~70% 줄입니다. grep_repomix_output이 점진적 콘텐츠 검색을 가능하게 하므로 일반적으로 필요하지 않습니다. 대형 저장소의 전체 코드베이스 내용이 특별히 필요한 경우에만 사용하세요.
- `includePatterns`: (선택) fast-glob 패턴을 사용하여 포함할 파일을 지정합니다. 여러 패턴은 쉼표로 구분할 수 있습니다(예: "**/*.{js,ts}", "src/**,docs/**"). 일치하는 파일만 처리됩니다.
- `ignorePatterns`: (선택) fast-glob 패턴을 사용하여 제외할 추가 파일을 지정합니다. 여러 패턴은 쉼표로 구분할 수 있습니다(예: "test/**,*.spec.js", "node_modules/**,dist/**"). 이러한 패턴은 .gitignore와 내장 제외를 보완합니다.
- `topFilesLength`: (선택, 기본값: 10) 코드베이스 분석을 위한 메트릭 요약에 표시할 크기별 최대 파일 수입니다.

**예시:**
```json
{
  "directory": "/path/to/your/project",
  "compress": false,
  "includePatterns": "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md",
  "ignorePatterns": "**/*.log,tmp/",
  "topFilesLength": 10
}
```

### pack_remote_repository

이 도구는 GitHub 저장소를 가져와 클론하고 AI 분석용 XML 파일로 패키징합니다. 원격 저장소를 자동으로 클론하고 구조를 분석하여 포괄적인 보고서를 생성합니다.

**매개변수:**
- `remote`: (필수) GitHub 저장소 URL 또는 사용자/저장소 형식(예: "yamadashy/repomix", "https://github.com/user/repo", 또는 "https://github.com/user/repo/tree/branch")
- `compress`: (선택, 기본값: false) 구현 세부사항을 제거하면서 필수 코드 시그니처와 구조를 추출하는 Tree-sitter 압축을 활성화합니다. 의미론적 의미를 유지하면서 토큰 사용량을 ~70% 줄입니다. grep_repomix_output이 점진적 콘텐츠 검색을 가능하게 하므로 일반적으로 필요하지 않습니다. 대형 저장소의 전체 코드베이스 내용이 특별히 필요한 경우에만 사용하세요.
- `includePatterns`: (선택) fast-glob 패턴을 사용하여 포함할 파일을 지정합니다. 여러 패턴은 쉼표로 구분할 수 있습니다(예: "**/*.{js,ts}", "src/**,docs/**"). 일치하는 파일만 처리됩니다.
- `ignorePatterns`: (선택) fast-glob 패턴을 사용하여 제외할 추가 파일을 지정합니다. 여러 패턴은 쉼표로 구분할 수 있습니다(예: "test/**,*.spec.js", "node_modules/**,dist/**"). 이러한 패턴은 .gitignore와 내장 제외를 보완합니다.
- `topFilesLength`: (선택, 기본값: 10) 코드베이스 분석을 위한 메트릭 요약에 표시할 크기별 최대 파일 수입니다.

**예시:**
```json
{
  "remote": "yamadashy/repomix",
  "compress": false,
  "includePatterns": "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md",
  "ignorePatterns": "**/*.log,tmp/",
  "topFilesLength": 10
}
```

### read_repomix_output

이 도구는 Repomix에서 생성된 출력 파일의 내용을 읽습니다. 대용량 파일에 대한 라인 범위 지정을 통한 부분 읽기를 지원합니다. 이 도구는 직접 파일 시스템 접근이 제한된 환경을 위해 설계되었습니다.

**매개변수:**
- `outputId`: (필수) 읽을 Repomix 출력 파일의 ID
- `startLine`: (선택) 시작 라인 번호(1부터 시작, 포함). 지정하지 않으면 처음부터 읽습니다.
- `endLine`: (선택) 끝 라인 번호(1부터 시작, 포함). 지정하지 않으면 끝까지 읽습니다.

**기능:**
- 웹 기반 환경이나 샌드박스 애플리케이션을 위해 특별히 설계됨
- ID를 사용하여 이전에 생성된 출력의 내용을 검색
- 파일 시스템 접근 없이 패키징된 코드베이스에 안전하게 접근 제공
- 대용량 파일의 부분 읽기 지원

**예시:**
```json
{
  "outputId": "8f7d3b1e2a9c6054",
  "startLine": 100,
  "endLine": 200
}
```

### grep_repomix_output

이 도구는 JavaScript RegExp 구문을 사용한 grep 유사 기능으로 Repomix 출력 파일에서 패턴을 검색합니다. 일치하는 라인과 일치 항목 주변의 선택적 컨텍스트 라인을 반환합니다.

**매개변수:**
- `outputId`: (필수) 검색할 Repomix 출력 파일의 ID
- `pattern`: (필수) 검색 패턴(JavaScript RegExp 정규 표현식 구문)
- `contextLines`: (선택, 기본값: 0) 각 일치 항목 전후에 표시할 컨텍스트 라인 수. beforeLines/afterLines가 지정되면 재정의됩니다.
- `beforeLines`: (선택) 각 일치 항목 전에 표시할 컨텍스트 라인 수(grep -B와 같음). contextLines보다 우선합니다.
- `afterLines`: (선택) 각 일치 항목 후에 표시할 컨텍스트 라인 수(grep -A와 같음). contextLines보다 우선합니다.
- `ignoreCase`: (선택, 기본값: false) 대소문자를 구분하지 않는 매칭 수행

**기능:**
- 강력한 패턴 매칭을 위한 JavaScript RegExp 구문 사용
- 일치 항목의 더 나은 이해를 위한 컨텍스트 라인 지원
- 전/후 컨텍스트 라인의 별도 제어 허용
- 대소문자 구분/비구분 검색 옵션

**예시:**
```json
{
  "outputId": "8f7d3b1e2a9c6054",
  "pattern": "function\\s+\\w+\\(",
  "contextLines": 3,
  "ignoreCase": false
}
```

### file_system_read_file 및 file_system_read_directory

Repomix의 MCP 서버는 AI 어시스턴트가 로컬 파일 시스템과 안전하게 상호 작용할 수 있는 두 가지 파일 시스템 도구를 제공합니다:

1. `file_system_read_file`
  - 절대 경로를 사용하여 로컬 파일 시스템에서 파일 내용 읽기
  - 민감한 정보가 포함된 파일에 대한 접근을 감지하고 방지하는 내장 보안 검증 포함
  - [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint)를 사용한 보안 검증 구현
  - 민감한 정보가 포함된 파일(API 키, 비밀번호, 시크릿)에 대한 접근 방지
  - 디렉토리 순회 공격을 방지하기 위한 절대 경로 검증
  - 잘못된 경로나 보안 문제에 대한 명확한 오류 메시지 반환

2. `file_system_read_directory`
  - 절대 경로를 사용하여 디렉토리의 내용 나열
  - 파일과 하위 디렉토리를 명확한 지표로 표시하는 포맷된 목록 반환
  - 파일과 디렉토리를 명확한 지표(`[FILE]` 또는 `[DIR]`)로 표시
  - 안전한 디렉토리 탐색과 적절한 오류 처리 제공
  - 경로 검증 및 절대 경로 확인
  - 프로젝트 구조 탐색과 코드베이스 조직 이해에 유용

두 도구 모두 강력한 보안 조치를 포함하고 있습니다:
- 디렉토리 순회 공격을 방지하기 위한 절대 경로 검증
- 적절한 접근 권한을 보장하기 위한 권한 검사
- 민감한 정보 감지를 위한 Secretlint 통합
- 디버깅과 보안 인식을 위한 명확한 오류 메시지

**예시:**
```typescript
// 파일 읽기
const fileContent = await tools.file_system_read_file({
  path: '/absolute/path/to/file.txt'
});

// 디렉토리 내용 나열
const dirContent = await tools.file_system_read_directory({
  path: '/absolute/path/to/directory'
});
```

이러한 도구는 AI 어시스턴트가 다음과 같은 작업을 수행해야 할 때 특히 유용합니다:
- 코드베이스의 특정 파일 분석
- 디렉토리 구조 탐색
- 파일 존재 여부 및 접근 가능성 확인
- 안전한 파일 시스템 작업 보장

## Repomix를 MCP 서버로 사용하는 이점

Repomix를 MCP 서버로 사용하면 여러 이점이 있습니다:

1. **직접 통합**: AI 어시스턴트가 수동 파일 준비 없이 코드베이스를 직접 분석할 수 있습니다.
2. **효율적인 워크플로우**: 파일을 수동으로 생성하고 업로드할 필요가 없어 코드 분석 프로세스가 간소화됩니다.
3. **일관된 출력**: AI 어시스턴트가 일관되고 최적화된 형식으로 코드베이스를 받을 수 있습니다.
4. **고급 기능**: 코드 압축, 토큰 카운팅, 보안 검사와 같은 Repomix의 모든 기능을 활용할 수 있습니다.

구성이 완료되면 AI 어시스턴트가 Repomix의 기능을 직접 사용하여 코드베이스를 분석할 수 있어 코드 분석 워크플로우가 더 효율적이 됩니다.

### 왜 XML을 기본 형식으로 사용하나요?

Repomix는 광범위한 연구와 테스트를 바탕으로 XML을 기본 출력 형식으로 채택했습니다. 이 결정은 실증적 증거와 AI 보조 코드 분석의 실용적 고려사항에 근거합니다.

XML 채택의 주요 이유는 주요 AI 제공업체의 공식 권장사항에 있습니다:
- **Anthropic (Claude)**: 프롬프트 구조화에서 XML 태그 사용을 명시적으로 권장하며, "Claude는 훈련 과정에서 그러한 프롬프트에 노출되었다"고 명시 ([문서](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/use-xml-tags))
- **Google (Gemini)**: 복잡한 작업에서 XML을 포함한 구조화된 형식을 권장 ([문서](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/structure-prompts))
- **OpenAI (GPT)**: 복잡한 시나리오에서 구조화된 프롬프팅을 권장 ([발표](https://x.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1890147300493914437), [cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5_prompting_guide))

## Markdown 형식

```bash
repomix --style markdown
```

Markdown은 읽기 쉬운 형식을 제공합니다:

### JSON 형식의 장점

JSON 형식은 다음 용도에 이상적입니다:
- **프로그래밍 처리**: 모든 프로그래밍 언어에서 JSON 라이브러리를 사용하여 쉽게 파싱하고 조작 가능
- **API 통합**: 웹 서비스 및 애플리케이션에서 직접 사용
- **AI 도구 호환성**: 기계 학습 및 AI 시스템에 최적화된 구조화된 형식
- **데이터 분석**: `jq`와 같은 도구를 사용하여 특정 정보를 간단히 추출

### `jq`를 사용한 JSON 출력 활용

JSON 형식을 사용하면 프로그래밍 방식으로 특정 정보를 쉽게 추출할 수 있습니다. 일반적인 예시는 다음과 같습니다:

#### 기본 파일 작업
```bash
# 모든 파일 경로 나열
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[]'

# 총 파일 수 계산
cat repomix-output.json | jq '.files | keys | length'

# 특정 파일 내용 추출
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files["README.md"]'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files["src/index.js"]'
```

#### 파일 필터링 및 분석
```bash
# 확장자로 파일 찾기
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(endswith(".ts"))'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(endswith(".js") or endswith(".ts"))'

# 특정 텍스트를 포함한 파일 찾기
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | select(.value | contains("function")) | .key'

# 문자 수와 함께 파일 목록 생성
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | "\(.key): \(.value | length) 문자"'
```

#### 메타데이터 추출
```bash
# 디렉토리 구조 추출
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.directoryStructure'

# 파일 요약 정보 가져오기
cat repomix-output.json | jq '.fileSummary.purpose'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.fileSummary.generationHeader'

# 사용자 제공 헤더 추출 (있는 경우)
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.userProvidedHeader // "헤더가 제공되지 않음"'

# 사용자 정의 지시사항 가져오기
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.instruction // "지시사항이 제공되지 않음"'
```

#### 고급 분석
```bash
# 내용 길이별 최대 파일 찾기
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | [.key, (.value | length)] | @tsv' | sort -k2 -nr | head -10

# 특정 패턴을 포함한 파일 검색
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | select(.value | test("import.*react"; "i")) | .key'

# 여러 확장자와 일치하는 파일 경로 추출
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(test("\.(js|ts|jsx|tsx)$"))'
```

## 일반 텍스트 형식

```bash
repomix --style plain
```

출력 구조:
```text

# 보안

## 보안 검사 기능

Repomix는 [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint)를 사용하여 파일 내의 민감한 정보를 감지합니다:
- API 키
- 액세스 토큰
- 인증 정보
- 개인 키
- 환경 변수

## 설정

보안 검사는 기본적으로 활성화되어 있습니다.

명령행에서 비활성화:
```bash
repomix --no-security-check
```

또는 `repomix.config.json`에서 설정:
```json
{
  "security": {
    "enableSecurityCheck": false
  }
}
```

## 보안 조치

1. **바이너리 파일 처리**: 바이너리 파일 내용은 출력에서 제외되지만 전체 저장소 개요를 위해 해당 경로는 디렉토리 구조에 나열됩니다
2. **Git 인식**: `.gitignore` 패턴을 준수
3. **자동 감지**: 다음과 같은 일반적인 보안 문제를 스캔:
    - AWS 자격 증명
    - 데이터베이스 연결 문자열
    - 인증 토큰
    - 개인 키

## 보안 검사에서 문제가 발견된 경우

출력 예시:
```bash
🔍 Security Check:
──────────────────
2 suspicious file(s) detected and excluded:
1. config/credentials.json
  - Found AWS access key
2. .env.local
  - Found database password
```

## 모범 사례

1. 공유하기 전에 반드시 출력 내용 검토
2. `.repomixignore`를 사용하여 민감한 경로 제외
3. 보안 검사 기능 활성화 유지
4. 저장소에서 민감한 파일 제거

## 보안 문제 보고

보안 취약점을 발견하셨다면:
1. 공개 이슈를 생성하지 마세요
2. 이메일: koukun0120@gmail.com
3. 또는 [GitHub 보안 권고](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/security/advisories/new) 사용

## File: website/client/src/ko/guide/usage.md
`````markdown
# 기본 사용법

## 빠른 시작

저장소 전체를 패키징:
```bash
repomix
```

## 일반적인 사용 사례

### 특정 디렉토리 패키징
```bash
repomix path/to/directory
```

### 특정 파일 포함
[glob 패턴](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax) 사용:
```bash
repomix --include "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md"
```

### 파일 제외
```bash
repomix --ignore "**/*.log,tmp/"
```

### 원격 저장소 처리
```bash
# GitHub URL 사용
repomix --remote https://github.com/user/repo

# 단축형 사용
repomix --remote user/repo

# 특정 브랜치/태그/커밋
repomix --remote user/repo --remote-branch main
repomix --remote user/repo --remote-branch 935b695
```

### 파일 목록 입력 (stdin)

최고의 유연성을 위해 stdin을 통해 파일 경로를 전달하세요:

```bash
# find 명령 사용
find src -name "*.ts" -type f | repomix --stdin

# git을 사용하여 추적된 파일 가져오기
git ls-files "*.ts" | repomix --stdin

# ripgrep (rg) 을 사용하여 파일 찾기
rg --files --type ts | repomix --stdin

# grep을 사용하여 특정 내용을 포함하는 파일 찾기
grep -l "TODO" **/*.ts | repomix --stdin

# ripgrep을 사용하여 특정 내용을 포함하는 파일 찾기
rg -l "TODO|FIXME" --type ts | repomix --stdin

# sharkdp/fd 를 사용하여 파일 찾기
fd -e ts | repomix --stdin

# fzf를 사용하여 모든 파일에서 선택
fzf -m | repomix --stdin

# fzf를 사용한 대화형 파일 선택
find . -name "*.ts" -type f | fzf -m | repomix --stdin

# glob 패턴과 함께 ls 사용
ls src/**/*.ts | repomix --stdin

# 파일 경로가 포함된 파일에서
cat file-list.txt | repomix --stdin

# echo로 직접 입력
echo -e "src/index.ts\nsrc/utils.ts" | repomix --stdin
```

`--stdin` 옵션을 사용하면 파일 경로 목록을 Repomix로 파이프할 수 있어 패킹할 파일 선택에 최고의 유연성을 제공합니다.

`--stdin`을 사용할 때 지정된 파일은 실질적으로 include 패턴에 추가됩니다. 즉, 일반적인 include 및 ignore 동작이 여전히 적용되므로 stdin으로 지정한 파일도 ignore 패턴과 일치하면 제외됩니다.

> [!NOTE]
> `--stdin`을 사용할 때 파일 경로는 상대 경로 또는 절대 경로가 될 수 있으며, Repomix가 자동으로 경로 해석과 중복 제거를 처리합니다.

### 코드 압축

```bash
repomix --compress

# 원격 저장소에서도 사용할 수 있습니다:
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix --compress
```

### Git 통합

AI 분석을 위한 개발 컨텍스트를 제공하기 위해 Git 정보를 포함합니다:

```bash
# git 차이점 포함 (커밋되지 않은 변경사항)
repomix --include-diffs

# git 커밋 로그 포함 (기본값: 최근 50개 커밋)
repomix --include-logs

# 특정 수의 커밋 포함
repomix --include-logs --include-logs-count 10

# 차이점과 로그 모두 포함
repomix --include-diffs --include-logs
```

이것은 다음과 같은 귀중한 컨텍스트를 추가합니다:
- **최근 변경사항**: Git 차이점은 커밋되지 않은 수정사항을 보여줍니다
- **개발 패턴**: Git 로그는 일반적으로 함께 변경되는 파일을 드러냅니다
- **커밋 히스토리**: 최근 커밋 메시지는 개발 초점에 대한 통찰을 제공합니다
- **파일 관계**: 같은 커밋에서 수정되는 파일들에 대한 이해

### 토큰 수 최적화

코드베이스의 토큰 분포를 이해하는 것은 AI 상호 작용을 최적화하는 데 중요합니다. `--token-count-tree` 옵션을 사용하여 프로젝트 전체의 토큰 사용량을 시각화하세요:

```bash
repomix --token-count-tree
```

이렇게 하면 토큰 수와 함께 코드베이스의 계층 뷰가 표시됩니다:

```
🔢 Token Count Tree:
────────────────────
└── src/ (70,925 tokens)
    ├── cli/ (12,714 tokens)
    │   ├── actions/ (7,546 tokens)
    │   └── reporters/ (990 tokens)
    └── core/ (41,600 tokens)
        ├── file/ (10,098 tokens)
        └── output/ (5,808 tokens)
```

최소 토큰 임계값을 설정하여 큰 파일에 집중할 수도 있습니다:

```bash
repomix --token-count-tree 1000  # 1000개 이상의 토큰을 가진 파일/디렉토리만 표시
```

이를 통해 다음을 수행할 수 있습니다:
- **토큰이 많은 파일 식별** - AI 컨텍스트 제한을 초과할 수 있는 파일 발견
- **파일 선택 최적화** - `--include` 및 `--ignore` 패턴 사용
- **압축 전략 계획** - 가장 큰 기여자를 대상으로 하는 전략
- **콘텐츠와 컨텍스트의 균형** - AI 분석을 위한 코드 준비 시 균형 조정

## 출력 형식

### XML (기본값)
```bash
repomix --style xml
```

### Markdown
```bash
repomix --style markdown
```

### JSON
```bash
repomix --style json
```

### 일반 텍스트
```bash
repomix --style plain
```

## 추가 옵션

### 주석 제거
```bash
repomix --remove-comments
```

### 행 번호 표시
```bash
repomix --output-show-line-numbers
```

### 클립보드에 복사
```bash
repomix --copy
```

### 보안 검사 비활성화
```bash
repomix --no-security-check
```

## 설정

설정 파일 초기화:
```bash
repomix --init
```

더 자세한 설정 옵션은 [설정 가이드](/ko/guide/configuration)를 참조하세요.

Repomix는 강력한 기능과 사용자 정의 옵션을 제공하는 명령줄 도구로 사용할 수 있습니다.

**CLI 도구는 프라이빗 저장소에 접근할 수 있습니다** 로컬에 설치된 Git을 사용하기 때문입니다.

### 빠른 시작

프로젝트 디렉토리에서 설치 없이 바로 Repomix를 시작할 수 있습니다:

```bash
npx repomix@latest
```

또는 반복 사용을 위해 전역 설치:

```bash
# npm으로 설치
npm install -g repomix

# 또는 yarn으로 설치
yarn global add repomix

# 또는 bun으로 설치
bun add -g repomix

# 또는 Homebrew로 설치 (macOS/Linux)
brew install repomix

# 그런 다음 아무 프로젝트 디렉토리에서 실행
repomix
```

이게 전부입니다! Repomix가 현재 디렉토리에 `repomix-output.xml` 파일을 생성하며, 이 파일에는 AI 친화적인 형식으로 정리된 전체 코드베이스가 포함됩니다.



### 사용법

전체 저장소를 패키징:

```bash
repomix
```

특정 디렉토리를 패키징:

```bash
repomix path/to/directory
```

[glob 패턴](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax)을 사용하여 특정 파일이나 디렉토리를 지정:

```bash
repomix --include "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md"
```

특정 파일이나 디렉토리 제외:

```bash
repomix --ignore "**/*.log,tmp/"
```

원격 저장소 처리:
```bash
# 단축형 사용
npx repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix

# 전체 URL 사용 (브랜치 및 특정 경로 지원)
npx repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix
npx repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/tree/main

# 커밋 URL 사용
npx repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/commit/836...
```

새 설정 파일(`repomix.config.json`) 초기화:

```bash
repomix --init
```

생성된 파일은 Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini와 같은 생성형 AI 도구와 함께 사용할 수 있습니다.

#### Docker 사용법

Docker를 사용하여 Repomix를 실행할 수도 있습니다 🐳  
격리된 환경에서 Repomix를 실행하거나 컨테이너를 선호하는 경우에 유용합니다.

기본 사용법(현재 디렉토리):

```bash
docker run -v .:/app -it --rm ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix
```

특정 디렉토리를 처리:
```bash
docker run -v .:/app -it --rm ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix path/to/directory
```

원격 저장소를 처리하고 `output` 디렉토리에 출력:

```bash
docker run -v ./output:/app -it --rm ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix
```

# Usando Repomix como Biblioteca

Além de usar o Repomix como ferramenta CLI, você pode integrar suas funcionalidades diretamente em suas aplicações Node.js.

## Instalação

Instale o Repomix como dependência em seu projeto:

```bash
npm install repomix
```

## Uso Básico

A maneira mais simples de usar o Repomix é através da função `runCli`, que proporciona a mesma funcionalidade da interface de linha de comando:

```javascript
import { runCli, type CliOptions } from 'repomix';

// Processar o diretório atual com opções personalizadas
async function packProject() {
  const options = {
    output: 'output.xml',
    style: 'xml',
    compress: true,
    quiet: true
  } as CliOptions;
  
  const result = await runCli(['.'], process.cwd(), options);
  return result.packResult;
}
```

O `result.packResult` contém informações sobre os arquivos processados, incluindo:
- `totalFiles`: Número de arquivos processados
- `totalCharacters`: Contagem total de caracteres
- `totalTokens`: Contagem total de tokens (útil para limites de contexto de LLM)
- `fileCharCounts`: Contagem de caracteres por arquivo
- `fileTokenCounts`: Contagem de tokens por arquivo

## Processamento de Repositórios Remotos

Você pode clonar e processar um repositório remoto:

```javascript
import { runCli, type CliOptions } from 'repomix';

// Clonar e processar um repositório GitHub
async function processRemoteRepo(repoUrl) {
  const options = {
    remote: repoUrl,
    output: 'output.xml',
    compress: true
  } as CliOptions;
  
  return await runCli(['.'], process.cwd(), options);
}
```

## Usando Componentes Principais

Para maior controle, você pode usar as APIs de baixo nível do Repomix diretamente:

```javascript
import { searchFiles, collectFiles, processFiles, TokenCounter } from 'repomix';

async function analyzeFiles(directory) {
  // Encontrar e coletar arquivos
  const { filePaths } = await searchFiles(directory, { /* configuração */ });
  const rawFiles = await collectFiles(filePaths, directory);
  const processedFiles = await processFiles(rawFiles, { /* configuração */ });
  
  // Contar tokens
  const tokenCounter = new TokenCounter('o200k_base');
  
  // Retornar resultados da análise
  return processedFiles.map(file => ({
    path: file.path,
    tokens: tokenCounter.countTokens(file.content)
  }));
}
```

## Exemplo do Mundo Real

O site do Repomix ([repomix.com](https://repomix.com)) usa o Repomix como biblioteca para processar repositórios remotos. Você pode ver a implementação em [website/server/src/remoteRepo.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/....ts).

# Melhores Práticas para Desenvolvimento com IA: Da Minha Experiência

Embora eu ainda não tenha concluído um grande projeto com IA, gostaria de compartilhar minhas experiências até agora no desenvolvimento com IA.

## Abordagem Básica de Desenvolvimento

Ao trabalhar com IA, tentar implementar todas as funcionalidades de uma vez pode levar a problemas inesperados e estagnação do projeto. Portanto, é mais eficaz começar com a funcionalidade principal e construir cada recurso individualmente, garantindo uma implementação sólida antes de prosseguir.

### O Poder do Código Existente

Essa abordagem é eficaz porque a implementação da funcionalidade principal permite materializar seu design ideal e estilo de codificação através de código real. A maneira mais eficaz de comunicar sua visão do projeto é através de código que reflita seus padrões e preferências.

Começando com funcionalidades principais e garantindo que cada componente funcione corretamente antes de avançar, o projeto inteiro mantém sua consistência, tornando mais fácil para a IA gerar código mais apropriado.

## Abordagem Modular

Dividir o código em módulos menores é crucial. Com base em minha experiência, limitar os arquivos a cerca de 250 linhas de código torna mais fácil dar instruções claras à IA e tornar o processo de tentativa e erro mais eficiente. Embora a contagem de tokens seria uma medida mais precisa, a contagem de linhas é mais prática para desenvolvedores humanos, então usamos isso como diretriz.

Essa modularização não se limita apenas à separação de componentes frontend, backend e banco de dados - trata-se de dividir a funcionalidade em um nível muito mais fino. Por exemplo, dentro de uma única função, você pode separar a validação, tratamento de erros e outras funcionalidades específicas em módulos separados.

## Garantia de Qualidade através de Testes

Considero os testes cruciais no desenvolvimento assistido por IA. Os testes servem não apenas como medidas de garantia de qualidade, mas também como documentação que demonstra claramente as intenções do código. Quando você pede à IA para implementar novos recursos, o código de teste existente serve efetivamente como um documento de especificação.

Os testes também são uma excelente ferramenta para validar a correção do código gerado pela IA. Por exemplo, se você fizer a IA implementar nova funcionalidade para um módulo, escrever casos de teste antecipadamente permite uma avaliação objetiva se o código gerado funciona conforme esperado.

## Equilíbrio entre Planejamento e Implementação

Antes de implementar recursos extensos, recomendo discutir primeiro o plano com a IA. Organizar os requisitos e considerar a arquitetura leva a uma implementação mais suave. Uma boa prática é primeiro compilar os requisitos e depois mudar para uma sessão de chat separada para o trabalho de implementação.

## Conclusão

Seguindo essas práticas, você pode aproveitar os pontos fortes da IA enquanto mantém uma base de código consistente e de alta qualidade. Mesmo à medida que seu projeto cresce, cada componente permanece bem definido e gerenciável.

# Geração de Agent Skills

O Repomix pode gerar saída no formato [Claude Agent Skills](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills), criando um diretório estruturado de Skills que pode ser usado como referência de código reutilizável para assistentes de IA.

Este recurso é particularmente poderoso quando você deseja referenciar implementações de repositórios remotos. Ao gerar Skills de projetos de código aberto, você pode facilmente pedir ao Claude para referenciar padrões ou implementações específicas enquanto trabalha em seu próprio código.

Em vez de gerar um único arquivo empacotado, a geração de Skills cria um diretório estruturado com múltiplos arquivos de referência otimizados para compreensão de IA e busca compatível com grep.

> [!NOTE]
> Este é um recurso experimental. O formato de saída e as opções podem mudar em versões futuras com base no feedback dos usuários.

## Uso Básico

Gerar Skills do seu diretório local:

```bash
# Gerar Skills do diretório atual
repomix --skill-generate

# Gerar com nome personalizado de Skills
repomix --skill-generate my-project-reference

# Gerar de um diretório específico
repomix path/to/directory --skill-generate

# Gerar de repositório remoto
repomix --remote https://github.com/user/repo --skill-generate
```

## Seleção de Local dos Skills

Quando você executa o comando, o Repomix solicita que você escolha onde salvar os Skills:

1. **Personal Skills** (`~/.claude/skills/`) - Disponível em todos os projetos na sua máquina
2. **Project Skills** (`.claude/skills/`) - Compartilhado com sua equipe via git

Se o diretório de Skills já existir, será solicitada confirmação para sobrescrever.

> [!TIP]
> Ao gerar Project Skills, considere adicioná-los ao `.gitignore` para evitar fazer commit de arquivos grandes:
> ```gitignore
> .claude/skills/repomix-reference-*/
> ```

## Estrutura Gerada

Os Skills são gerados com a seguinte estrutura:

```text
.claude/skills/<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md                    # Metadados principais e documentação dos Skills
└── references/
    ├── summary.md              # Propósito, formato e estatísticas
    ├── project-structure.md    # Árvore de diretórios com contagem de linhas
    ├── files.md                # Todo o conteúdo dos arquivos (compatível com grep)
    └── tech-stack.md           # Linguagens, frameworks, dependências
```

### Descrições dos Arquivos

#### SKILL.md

O arquivo principal dos Skills contém:
- Nome dos Skills, descrição e informações do projeto
- Contagem de arquivos, linhas e tokens
- Visão geral de como usar os Skills
- Localizações dos arquivos e explicação do formato
- Casos de uso comuns e dicas

#### references/summary.md

Contém:
- **Propósito**: Explica que é uma base de código de referência para consumo de IA
- **Estrutura de Arquivos**: Documenta o conteúdo de cada arquivo de referência
- **Diretrizes de Uso**: Como usar os Skills efetivamente
- **Estatísticas**: Divisão por tipo de arquivo, linguagem e maiores arquivos

#### references/project-structure.md

Árvore de diretórios com contagem de linhas por arquivo para fácil descoberta:

```text
src/
  index.ts (42 lines)
  utils/
    helpers.ts (128 lines)
    math.ts (87 lines)
```

#### references/files.md

Todo o conteúdo dos arquivos com cabeçalhos de destaque de sintaxe, otimizado para busca compatível com grep:

````markdown
## File: src/index.ts
```typescript
import { sum } from './utils/helpers';

export function main() {
  console.log(sum(1, 2));
}
```
````

#### references/tech-stack.md

Stack tecnológico auto-detectado dos arquivos de dependências:
- **Linguagens**: TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, etc.
- **Frameworks**: React, Next.js, Express, Django, etc.
- **Versões de Runtime**: Node.js, Python, Go, etc.
- **Gerenciador de Pacotes**: npm, pnpm, poetry, etc.
- **Dependências**: Todas as dependências diretas e de desenvolvimento
- **Arquivos de Configuração**: Todos os arquivos de configuração detectados

Detectado de arquivos como: `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `.nvmrc`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.

## Nomes de Skills Auto-Gerados

Se nenhum nome for fornecido, o Repomix auto-gera um usando este padrão:

```bash
repomix src/ --skill-generate                # → repomix-reference-src
repomix --remote user/repo --skill-generate  # → repomix-reference-repo
repomix --skill-generate CustomName          # → custom-name (normalizado para kebab-case)
```

Os nomes de Skills são:
- Convertidos para kebab-case (minúsculas, separados por hífen)
- Limitados a no máximo 64 caracteres
- Protegidos contra path traversal

## Integração com Opções do Repomix

A geração de Skills respeita todas as opções padrão do Repomix:

```bash
# Gerar Skills com filtragem de arquivos
repomix --skill-generate --include "src/**/*.ts" --ignore "**/*.test.ts"

# Gerar Skills com compressão
repomix --skill-generate --compress

# Gerar Skills de repositório remoto
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix --skill-generate

# Gerar Skills com opções específicas de formato de saída
repomix --skill-generate --remove-comments --remove-empty-lines
```

### Skills Apenas de Documentação

Usando `--include`, você pode gerar Skills contendo apenas a documentação de um repositório GitHub. Isso é útil quando você quer que o Claude referencie documentação específica de biblioteca ou framework enquanto trabalha em seu código:

```bash
# Documentação do Claude Code Action
repomix --remote https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action --include docs --skill-generate

# Documentação do Vite
repomix --remote https://github.com/vitejs/vite --include docs --skill-generate

# Documentação do React
repomix --remote https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev --include src/content --skill-generate
```

## Limitações

A opção `--skill-generate` não pode ser usada com:
- `--stdout` - A saída de Skills requer escrita no sistema de arquivos
- `--copy` - A saída de Skills é um diretório, não pode ser copiado para a área de transferência

## Usando Skills Gerados

Uma vez gerados, você pode usar os Skills com o Claude:

1. **Claude Code**: Os Skills estão automaticamente disponíveis se salvos em `~/.claude/skills/` ou `.claude/skills/`
2. **Claude Web**: Faça upload do diretório de Skills para o Claude para análise de base de código
3. **Compartilhamento de Equipe**: Faça commit de `.claude/skills/` no seu repositório para acesso de toda a equipe

## Exemplo de Workflow

### Criando uma Biblioteca de Referência Pessoal

```bash
# Clone e analise um projeto de código aberto interessante
repomix --remote facebook/react --skill-generate react-reference

# Os Skills são salvos em ~/.claude/skills/react-reference/
# Agora você pode referenciar a base de código do React em qualquer conversa com o Claude
```

### Documentação de Projeto de Equipe

```bash
# No seu diretório de projeto
cd my-project

# Gere Skills para sua equipe
repomix --skill-generate

# Escolha "Project Skills" quando solicitado
# Os Skills são salvos em .claude/skills/repomix-reference-my-project/

# Faça commit e compartilhe com sua equipe
git add .claude/skills/
git commit -m "Add codebase reference Skills"
```

# Compressão de Código

A compressão de código é um recurso poderoso que extrai estruturas essenciais do código de forma inteligente enquanto remove detalhes de implementação. Isso é particularmente útil para reduzir a contagem de tokens enquanto mantém informações estruturais importantes sobre sua base de código.

> [!NOTE]
> Este é um recurso experimental que estaremos melhorando ativamente com base no feedback dos usuários e no uso no mundo real.

## Uso Básico

Ative a compressão de código usando a flag `--compress`:

```bash
repomix --compress
```

Você também pode usá-la com repositórios remotos:

```bash
repomix --remote user/repo --compress
```

## Como Funciona

O algoritmo de compressão processa o código usando análise Tree-sitter para extrair e preservar elementos estruturais essenciais enquanto remove detalhes de implementação.

A compressão preserva:
- Assinaturas de funções e métodos
- Definições de interfaces e tipos
- Estruturas de classes e propriedades
- Elementos estruturais importantes

Enquanto remove:
- Implementações de funções e métodos
- Detalhes de lógica de loops e condicionais
- Declarações de variáveis internas
- Código específico de implementação

### Exemplo

Código TypeScript original:

```typescript
import { ShoppingItem } from './shopping-item';

/**
 * Calculate the total price of shopping items
 */
const calculateTotal = (
  items: ShoppingItem[]
) => {
  let total = 0;
  for (const item of items) {
    total += item.price * item.quantity;
  }
  return total;
}

// Shopping item interface
interface Item {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  quantity: number;
}
```

Após a compressão:

```typescript
import { ShoppingItem } from './shopping-item';
⋮----
/**
 * Calculate the total price of shopping items
 */
const calculateTotal = (
  items: ShoppingItem[]
) => {
⋮----
// Shopping item interface
interface Item {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  quantity: number;
}
```

## Configuração

Você pode ativar a compressão em seu arquivo de configuração:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "compress": true
  }
}
```

## Casos de Uso

A compressão de código é particularmente útil quando:
- Analisando estrutura e arquitetura do código
- Reduzindo contagem de tokens para processamento LLM
- Criando documentação de alto nível
- Compreendendo padrões e assinaturas de código
- Compartilhando designs de API e interface

## Opções Relacionadas

Você pode combinar a compressão com outras opções:
- `--remove-comments`: Remover comentários do código
- `--remove-empty-lines`: Remover linhas vazias
- `--output-show-line-numbers`: Adicionar números de linha à saída

## File: website/client/src/pt-br/guide/comment-removal.md
`````markdown
# Remoção de Comentários

O Repomix pode remover automaticamente os comentários do seu código ao gerar o arquivo de saída. Isso pode ajudar a reduzir o ruído e focar no código real.

## Uso

Para habilitar a remoção de comentários, defina a opção `removeComments` como `true` no seu `repomix.config.json`:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "removeComments": true
  }
}
```

## Linguagens Suportadas

O Repomix suporta a remoção de comentários para uma ampla gama de linguagens de programação, incluindo:

- JavaScript/TypeScript (`//`, `/* */`)
- Python (`#`, `"""`, `'''`)
- Java (`//`, `/* */`)
- C/C++ (`//`, `/* */`)
- HTML (`<!-- -->`)
- CSS (`/* */`)
- E muitas outras...

## Exemplo

Dado o seguinte código JavaScript:

```javascript
// Este é um comentário de linha única
function test() {
  /* Este é um
     comentário de várias linhas */
  return true;
}
```

Com a remoção de comentários habilitada, a saída será:

```javascript
function test() {
  return true;
}
```

## Notas

- A remoção de comentários é realizada antes de outras etapas de processamento, como a adição de números de linha.
- Alguns comentários, como os comentários JSDoc, podem ser preservados dependendo da linguagem e do contexto.

# Configuração

O Repomix pode ser configurado usando um arquivo de configuração ou opções de linha de comando. O arquivo de configuração permite que você personalize vários aspectos de como seu código-fonte é processado e gerado.

## Formatos de arquivos de configuração

O Repomix suporta múltiplos formatos de arquivos de configuração para flexibilidade e facilidade de uso.

O Repomix buscará automaticamente arquivos de configuração na seguinte ordem de prioridade:

1. **TypeScript** (`repomix.config.ts`, `repomix.config.mts`, `repomix.config.cts`)
2. **JavaScript/ES Module** (`repomix.config.js`, `repomix.config.mjs`, `repomix.config.cjs`)
3. **JSON** (`repomix.config.json5`, `repomix.config.jsonc`, `repomix.config.json`)

### Configuração JSON

Crie um arquivo de configuração no diretório do seu projeto:
```bash
repomix --init
```

Isso criará um arquivo `repomix.config.json` com as configurações padrão. Você também pode criar um arquivo de configuração global que será usado como fallback quando nenhuma configuração local for encontrada:

```bash
repomix --init --global
```

### Configuração TypeScript

Os arquivos de configuração TypeScript oferecem a melhor experiência de desenvolvimento com verificação completa de tipos e suporte IDE.

**Instalação:**

Para usar a configuração TypeScript ou JavaScript com `defineConfig`, você precisa instalar o Repomix como dependência de desenvolvimento:

```bash
npm install -D repomix
```

**Exemplo:**

```typescript
// repomix.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'repomix';

export default defineConfig({
  output: {
    filePath: 'output.xml',
    style: 'xml',
    removeComments: true,
  },
  ignore: {
    customPatterns: ['**/node_modules/**', '**/dist/**'],
  },
});
```

**Vantagens:**
- ✅ Verificação completa de tipos TypeScript em seu IDE
- ✅ Excelente autocompletar e IntelliSense do IDE
- ✅ Uso de valores dinâmicos (timestamps, variáveis de ambiente, etc.)

**Exemplo de valores dinâmicos:**

```typescript
// repomix.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'repomix';

// Gerar nome de arquivo baseado em timestamp
const timestamp = new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 19).replace(/[:.]/g, '-');

export default defineConfig({
  output: {
    filePath: `output-${timestamp}.xml`,
    style: 'xml',
  },
});
```

### Configuração JavaScript

Os arquivos de configuração JavaScript funcionam da mesma forma que TypeScript, suportando `defineConfig` e valores dinâmicos.

Você pode habilitar a validação de esquema para seu arquivo de configuração adicionando a propriedade `$schema`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://repomix.com/schemas/latest/schema.json",
  "output": {
    "filePath": "repomix-output.md",
    "style": "markdown"
  }
}
```

Isso fornece autocompletar e validação em editores que suportam esquema JSON.

## Exemplo de arquivo de configuração

Aqui está um exemplo de um arquivo de configuração completo (`repomix.config.json`):

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://repomix.com/schemas/latest/schema.json",
  "input": {
    "maxFileSize": 50000000
  },
  "output": {
    "filePath": "repomix-output.xml",
    "style": "xml",
    "parsableStyle": false,
    "compress": false,
    "headerText": "Informações de cabeçalho personalizadas para o arquivo empacotado.",
    "fileSummary": true,
    "directoryStructure": true,
    "files": true,
    "removeComments": false,
    "removeEmptyLines": false,
    "topFilesLength": 5,
    "showLineNumbers": false,
    "truncateBase64": false,
    "copyToClipboard": false,
    "includeEmptyDirectories": false,
    "git": {
      "sortByChanges": true,
      "sortByChangesMaxCommits": 100,
      "includeDiffs": false,
      "includeLogs": false,
      "includeLogsCount": 50
    }
  },
  "include": ["**/*"],
  "ignore": {
    "useGitignore": true,
    "useDefaultPatterns": true,
    // Os padrões também podem ser especificados em .repomixignore
    "customPatterns": [
      "additional-folder",
      "**/*.log"
    ],
  },
  "security": {
    "enableSecurityCheck": true
  },
  "tokenCount": {
    "encoding": "o200k_base"
  }
}
```

## Locais dos arquivos de configuração

O Repomix procura os arquivos de configuração na seguinte ordem:
1. Arquivo de configuração local no diretório atual (ordem de prioridade: TS > JS > JSON)
   - TypeScript: `repomix.config.ts`, `repomix.config.mts`, `repomix.config.cts`
   - JavaScript: `repomix.config.js`, `repomix.config.mjs`, `repomix.config.cjs`
   - JSON: `repomix.config.json5`, `repomix.config.jsonc`, `repomix.config.json`
2. Arquivo de configuração global (ordem de prioridade: TS > JS > JSON)
   - Windows:
     - TypeScript: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.ts`, `.mts`, `.cts`
     - JavaScript: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`
     - JSON: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.json5`, `.jsonc`, `.json`
   - macOS/Linux:
     - TypeScript: `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.ts`, `.mts`, `.cts`
     - JavaScript: `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`
     - JSON: `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.json5`, `.jsonc`, `.json`

As opções de linha de comando têm precedência sobre as configurações do arquivo.

## Padrões de inclusão

O Repomix suporta especificar arquivos para incluir usando [padrões glob](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax). Isso permite uma seleção de arquivos mais flexível e poderosa:

- Use `**/*.js` para incluir todos os arquivos JavaScript em qualquer diretório
- Use `src/**/*` para incluir todos os arquivos dentro do diretório `src` e seus subdiretórios
- Combine múltiplos padrões como `["src/**/*.js", "**/*.md"]` para incluir arquivos JavaScript em `src` e todos os arquivos Markdown

Você pode especificar padrões de inclusão em seu arquivo de configuração:

```json
{
  "include": ["src/**/*", "tests/**/*.test.js"]
}
```

Ou use a opção de linha de comando `--include` para filtragem única.

## Padrões de ignorar

O Repomix oferece múltiplos métodos para definir padrões de ignorar para excluir arquivos ou diretórios específicos durante o processo de empacotamento:

- **.gitignore**: Por padrão, são utilizados os padrões listados nos arquivos `.gitignore` do seu projeto e `.git/info/exclude`. Este comportamento pode ser controlado com a configuração `ignore.useGitignore` ou a opção CLI `--no-gitignore`.
- **.ignore**: Você pode usar um arquivo `.ignore` na raiz do seu projeto, seguindo o mesmo formato que `.gitignore`. Este arquivo é respeitado por ferramentas como ripgrep e the silver searcher, reduzindo a necessidade de manter múltiplos arquivos de ignorar. Este comportamento pode ser controlado com a configuração `ignore.useDotIgnore` ou a opção CLI `--no-dot-ignore`.
- **Padrões padrão**: O Repomix inclui uma lista padrão de arquivos e diretórios comumente excluídos (por exemplo, node_modules, .git, arquivos binários). Esta funcionalidade pode ser controlada com a configuração `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` ou a opção CLI `--no-default-patterns`. Por favor, consulte [defaultIgnore.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/src/config/defaultIgnore.ts) para mais detalhes.
- **.repomixignore**: Você pode criar um arquivo `.repomixignore` na raiz do seu projeto para definir padrões de ignorar específicos do Repomix. Este arquivo segue o mesmo formato que `.gitignore`.
- **Padrões personalizados**: Padrões de ignorar adicionais podem ser especificados usando a opção `ignore.customPatterns` no arquivo de configuração. Você pode sobrescrever esta configuração com a opção de linha de comando `-i, --ignore`.

**Ordem de prioridade** (da mais alta para a mais baixa):

1. Padrões personalizados (`ignore.customPatterns`)
2. Arquivos de ignorar (`.repomixignore`, `.ignore`, `.gitignore` e `.git/info/exclude`):
   - Quando em diretórios aninhados, arquivos em diretórios mais profundos têm prioridade mais alta
   - Quando no mesmo diretório, esses arquivos são mesclados sem uma ordem particular
3. Padrões padrão (se `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` for verdadeiro e `--no-default-patterns` não for usado)

Esta abordagem permite uma configuração flexível de exclusão de arquivos com base nas necessidades do seu projeto. Ajuda a otimizar o tamanho do arquivo empacotado gerado, garantindo a exclusão de arquivos sensíveis à segurança e arquivos binários grandes, enquanto previne o vazamento de informações confidenciais.

**Nota:** Os arquivos binários não são incluídos na saída empacotada por padrão, mas seus caminhos são listados na seção "Estrutura do Repositório" do arquivo de saída. Isso fornece uma visão completa da estrutura do repositório enquanto mantém o arquivo empacotado eficiente e baseado em texto. Veja [Tratamento de Arquivos Binários](#tratamento-de-arquivos-binários) para mais detalhes.

Exemplo de `.repomixignore`:
```text
# Diretórios de cache
.cache/
tmp/

# Saídas de compilação
dist/
build/

# Registros
*.log
```

## Padrões de ignorar padrão

Quando `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` é verdadeiro, o Repomix ignora automaticamente padrões comuns:
```text
node_modules/**
.git/**
coverage/**
dist/**
```

Para a lista completa, veja [defaultIgnore.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/src/config/defaultIgnore.ts)

## Tratamento de Arquivos Binários

Arquivos binários (como imagens, PDFs, binários compilados, arquivos compactados, etc.) são tratados especialmente para manter uma saída eficiente baseada em texto:

- **Conteúdos de arquivo**: Arquivos binários **não são incluídos** na saída empacotada para manter o arquivo baseado em texto e eficiente para processamento de IA
- **Estrutura de diretórios**: Caminhos de arquivos binários **são listados** na seção de estrutura de diretórios, fornecendo uma visão completa do seu repositório

Esta abordagem garante que você obtenha uma visão completa da estrutura do seu repositório enquanto mantém uma saída eficiente baseada em texto otimizada para consumo de IA.

**Exemplo:**

Se o seu repositório contém `logo.png` e `app.jar`:
- Eles aparecerão na seção Estrutura de Diretórios
- Seus conteúdos não serão incluídos na seção Arquivos

**Saída de Estrutura de Diretórios:**
```
src/
  index.ts
  utils.ts
assets/
  logo.png
build/
  app.jar
```

Dessa forma, as ferramentas de IA podem entender que esses arquivos binários existem na estrutura do seu projeto sem processar seus conteúdos binários.

**Nota:** Você pode controlar o limite de tamanho máximo de arquivo usando a opção de configuração `input.maxFileSize` (padrão: 50MB). Arquivos maiores que esse limite serão completamente ignorados.

## Recursos avançados

### Compressão de código

O recurso de compressão de código, habilitado com `output.compress: true`, usa [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) para extrair inteligentemente estruturas de código essenciais enquanto remove detalhes de implementação. Isso ajuda a reduzir a contagem de tokens enquanto mantém informações estruturais importantes.

Benefícios principais:
- Reduz significativamente a contagem de tokens
- Preserva as assinaturas de classes e funções
- Mantém importações e exportações
- Conserva definições de tipos e interfaces
- Remove corpos de funções e detalhes de implementação

Para mais detalhes e exemplos, consulte o [Guia de compressão de código](code-compress).

### Integração com Git

A configuração `output.git` fornece recursos poderosos relacionados ao Git:

- `sortByChanges`: Quando verdadeiro, os arquivos são ordenados por número de alterações Git (commits que modificaram o arquivo). Arquivos com mais alterações aparecem no final da saída. Isso ajuda a priorizar os arquivos mais ativamente desenvolvidos. Padrão: `true`
- `sortByChangesMaxCommits`: O número máximo de commits para analisar ao contar alterações de arquivos. Padrão: `100`
- `includeDiffs`: Quando verdadeiro, inclui as diferenças Git na saída (inclui separadamente as alterações da árvore de trabalho e as alterações preparadas). Isso permite que o leitor veja as alterações pendentes no repositório. Padrão: `false`
- `includeLogs`: Quando verdadeiro, inclui o histórico de commits Git na saída. Mostra datas de commit, mensagens e caminhos de arquivos para cada commit. Isso ajuda a IA a entender padrões de desenvolvimento e relacionamentos entre arquivos. Padrão: `false`
- `includeLogsCount`: O número de commits recentes para incluir nos logs git. Padrão: `50`

Exemplo de configuração:
```json
{
  "output": {
    "git": {
      "sortByChanges": true,
      "sortByChangesMaxCommits": 100,
      "includeDiffs": true,
      "includeLogs": true,
      "includeLogsCount": 25
    }
  }
}
```

### Verificações de segurança

Quando `security.enableSecurityCheck` está habilitado, o Repomix usa [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint) para detectar informações sensíveis em seu código-fonte antes de incluí-las na saída. Isso ajuda a prevenir a exposição acidental de:

- Chaves de API
- Tokens de acesso
- Chaves privadas
- Senhas
- Outras credenciais sensíveis

### Remoção de comentários

Quando `output.removeComments` é definido como `true`, os comentários são removidos dos tipos de arquivos suportados para reduzir o tamanho da saída e focar no conteúdo essencial do código. Isso pode ser particularmente útil quando:

- Você está trabalhando com código altamente documentado
- Você está tentando reduzir a contagem de tokens
- Você está focando na estrutura e lógica do código

Para os idiomas suportados e exemplos detalhados, consulte o [Guia de remoção de comentários](comment-removal).

# Instruções Personalizadas

O Repomix permite que você forneça instruções personalizadas que serão incluídas no arquivo de saída. Isso pode ser útil para adicionar contexto ou diretrizes específicas para sistemas de IA que processam o repositório.

## Uso

Para incluir uma instrução personalizada, crie um arquivo markdown (por exemplo, `repomix-instruction.md`) na raiz do seu repositório. Em seguida, especifique o caminho para este arquivo no seu `repomix.config.json`:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "instructionFilePath": "repomix-instruction.md"
  }
}
```

O conteúdo deste arquivo será incluído na saída sob a seção "Instruction".

## Exemplo

```markdown
# Instruções do Repositório

Este repositório contém o código-fonte da ferramenta Repomix. Por favor, siga estas diretrizes ao analisar o código:

1. Concentre-se na funcionalidade principal no diretório `src/core`.
2. Preste atenção especial às verificações de segurança em `src/core/security`.
3. Ignore quaisquer arquivos no diretório `tests`.
```

Isso resultará na seguinte seção na saída:

```xml
<instruction>
# Instruções do Repositório

Este repositório contém o código-fonte da ferramenta Repomix. Por favor, siga estas diretrizes ao analisar o código:

1. Concentre-se na funcionalidade principal no diretório `src/core`.
2. Preste atenção especial às verificações de segurança em `src/core/security`.
3. Ignore quaisquer arquivos no diretório `tests`.
</instruction>

# Usando o Repomix com GitHub Actions

Você pode automatizar o empacotamento do seu código para análise por IA integrando o Repomix aos seus workflows do GitHub Actions. Isso é útil para integração contínua (CI), revisão de código ou preparação para ferramentas LLM.

## Uso básico

Adicione o seguinte passo ao seu arquivo YAML de workflow para empacotar seu repositório:

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    output: repomix-output.xml
```

## Usando diferentes formatos de saída

Você pode especificar diferentes formatos de saída usando o parâmetro `style` (o padrão é `xml`):

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    output: repomix-output.md
    style: markdown
```

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix (JSON format)
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    output: repomix-output.json
    style: json
```

## Empacotando múltiplos diretórios com compressão

Você pode especificar múltiplos diretórios, padrões de inclusão/exclusão e ativar a compressão inteligente:

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    directories: src tests
    include: "**/*.ts,**/*.md"
    ignore: "**/*.test.ts"
    output: repomix-output.txt
    compress: true
```

## Enviando o arquivo de saída como artefato

Para disponibilizar o arquivo empacotado para etapas posteriores ou para download, envie-o como artefato:

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    directories: src
    output: repomix-output.xml
    compress: true

- name: Upload Repomix output
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: repomix-output
    path: repomix-output.xml
```

# Servidor MCP

O Repomix suporta o [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), permitindo que assistentes de IA interajam diretamente com sua base de código. Quando executado como um servidor MCP, o Repomix fornece ferramentas que permitem aos assistentes de IA empacotar repositórios locais ou remotos para análise sem necessidade de preparação manual de arquivos.

> [!NOTE]  
> Este é um recurso experimental que estaremos melhorando ativamente com base no feedback dos usuários e no uso no mundo real

## Executando o Repomix como um Servidor MCP

Para executar o Repomix como um servidor MCP, use a flag `--mcp`:

```bash
repomix --mcp
```

Isso inicia o Repomix no modo servidor MCP, tornando-o disponível para assistentes de IA que suportam o Model Context Protocol.

## Configurando Servidores MCP

Para usar o Repomix como um servidor MCP com assistentes de IA como o Claude, você precisa configurar as definições do MCP:

### Para VS Code

Você pode instalar o servidor MCP do Repomix no VS Code usando um destes métodos:

1. **Usando o distintivo de instalação:**

  [![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-VS_Code?style=flat-square&label=Install%20Server&color=0098FF)](vscode:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22repomix%22%2C%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22repomix%22%2C%22--mcp%22%5D%7D)<br>
  [![Install in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-VS_Code_Insiders?style=flat-square&label=Install%20Server&color=24bfa5)](vscode-insiders:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22repomix%22%2C%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22repomix%22%2C%22--mcp%22%5D%7D)

2. **Usando a linha de comando:**

  ```bash
  code --add-mcp '{"name":"repomix","command":"npx","args":["-y","repomix","--mcp"]}'
  ```

  Para VS Code Insiders:
  ```bash
  code-insiders --add-mcp '{"name":"repomix","command":"npx","args":["-y","repomix","--mcp"]}'
  ```

### Para o Cline (extensão do VS Code)

Edite o arquivo `cline_mcp_settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "repomix": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "repomix",
        "--mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Para o Cursor

No Cursor, adicione um novo servidor MCP a partir de `Cursor Settings` > `MCP` > `+ Add new global MCP server` com uma configuração similar à do Cline.

### Para o Claude Desktop

Edite o arquivo `claude_desktop_config.json` com uma configuração similar à do Cline.

### Para o Claude Code

Para configurar o Repomix como servidor MCP no [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview), use o seguinte comando:

```bash
claude mcp add repomix -- npx -y repomix --mcp
```

Alternativamente, você pode usar os **plugins oficiais do Repomix** para uma experiência mais conveniente. Os plugins fornecem comandos em linguagem natural e configuração mais fácil. Consulte a documentação [Plugins do Claude Code](/pt-br/guide/claude-code-plugins) para obter detalhes.

### Usando Docker em vez de npx

Em vez de usar npx, você pode usar o Docker para executar o Repomix como um servidor MCP:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "repomix-docker": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",

## Ferramentas MCP Disponíveis

Quando executado como um servidor MCP, o Repomix fornece as seguintes ferramentas:

### pack_codebase

Esta ferramenta empacota um diretório de código local em um arquivo XML para análise de IA. Ela analisa a estrutura da base de código, extrai conteúdo de código relevante e gera um relatório abrangente incluindo métricas, árvore de arquivos e conteúdo de código formatado.

**Parâmetros:**
- `directory`: (Obrigatório) Caminho absoluto para o diretório a ser empacotado
- `compress`: (Opcional, padrão: false) Habilita compressão Tree-sitter para extrair assinaturas de código essenciais e estrutura enquanto remove detalhes de implementação. Reduz o uso de tokens em ~70% mantendo o significado semântico. Geralmente não é necessário já que grep_repomix_output permite recuperação incremental de conteúdo. Use apenas quando você especificamente precisar do conteúdo completo da base de código para repositórios grandes.
- `includePatterns`: (Opcional) Especifica arquivos para incluir usando padrões fast-glob. Múltiplos padrões podem ser separados por vírgula (ex: "**/*.{js,ts}", "src/**,docs/**"). Apenas arquivos correspondentes serão processados.
- `ignorePatterns`: (Opcional) Especifica arquivos adicionais para excluir usando padrões fast-glob. Múltiplos padrões podem ser separados por vírgula (ex: "test/**,*.spec.js", "node_modules/**,dist/**"). Estes padrões complementam .gitignore e exclusões integradas.
- `topFilesLength`: (Opcional, padrão: 10) Número de maiores arquivos por tamanho para exibir no resumo de métricas para análise da base de código.

**Exemplo:**
```json
{
  "directory": "/path/to/your/project",
  "compress": false,
  "includePatterns": "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md",
  "ignorePatterns": "**/*.log,tmp/",
  "topFilesLength": 10
}
```

### pack_remote_repository

Esta ferramenta busca, clona e empacota um repositório GitHub em um arquivo XML para análise de IA. Ela automaticamente clona o repositório remoto, analisa sua estrutura e gera um relatório abrangente.

**Parâmetros:**
- `remote`: (Obrigatório) URL do repositório GitHub ou formato usuário/repo (ex: "yamadashy/repomix", "https://github.com/user/repo", ou "https://github.com/user/repo/tree/branch")
- `compress`: (Opcional, padrão: false) Habilita compressão Tree-sitter para extrair assinaturas de código essenciais e estrutura enquanto remove detalhes de implementação. Reduz o uso de tokens em ~70% mantendo o significado semântico. Geralmente não é necessário já que grep_repomix_output permite recuperação incremental de conteúdo. Use apenas quando você especificamente precisar do conteúdo completo da base de código para repositórios grandes.
- `includePatterns`: (Opcional) Especifica arquivos para incluir usando padrões fast-glob. Múltiplos padrões podem ser separados por vírgula (ex: "**/*.{js,ts}", "src/**,docs/**"). Apenas arquivos correspondentes serão processados.
- `ignorePatterns`: (Opcional) Especifica arquivos adicionais para excluir usando padrões fast-glob. Múltiplos padrões podem ser separados por vírgula (ex: "test/**,*.spec.js", "node_modules/**,dist/**"). Estes padrões complementam .gitignore e exclusões integradas.
- `topFilesLength`: (Opcional, padrão: 10) Número de maiores arquivos por tamanho para exibir no resumo de métricas para análise da base de código.

**Exemplo:**
```json
{
  "remote": "yamadashy/repomix",
  "compress": false,
  "includePatterns": "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md",
  "ignorePatterns": "**/*.log,tmp/",
  "topFilesLength": 10
}
```

### read_repomix_output

Esta ferramenta lê o conteúdo de um arquivo de saída gerado pelo Repomix. Suporta leitura parcial com especificação de intervalo de linhas para arquivos grandes. Esta ferramenta é projetada para ambientes onde o acesso direto ao sistema de arquivos é limitado.

**Parâmetros:**
- `outputId`: (Obrigatório) ID do arquivo de saída do Repomix a ser lido
- `startLine`: (Opcional) Número da linha inicial (baseado em 1, inclusivo). Se não especificado, lê desde o início.
- `endLine`: (Opcional) Número da linha final (baseado em 1, inclusivo). Se não especificado, lê até o final.

**Funcionalidades:**
- Projetado especificamente para ambientes baseados na web ou aplicações em sandbox
- Recupera o conteúdo de saídas geradas anteriormente usando seu ID
- Fornece acesso seguro à base de código empacotada sem requerer acesso ao sistema de arquivos
- Suporta leitura parcial para arquivos grandes

**Exemplo:**
```json
{
  "outputId": "8f7d3b1e2a9c6054",
  "startLine": 100,
  "endLine": 200
}
```

### grep_repomix_output

Esta ferramenta busca padrões em um arquivo de saída do Repomix usando funcionalidade similar ao grep com sintaxe JavaScript RegExp. Retorna linhas correspondentes com linhas de contexto opcionais ao redor das correspondências.

**Parâmetros:**
- `outputId`: (Obrigatório) ID do arquivo de saída do Repomix para buscar
- `pattern`: (Obrigatório) Padrão de busca (sintaxe de expressão regular JavaScript RegExp)
- `contextLines`: (Opcional, padrão: 0) Número de linhas de contexto para mostrar antes e depois de cada correspondência. Sobrescrito por beforeLines/afterLines se especificado.
- `beforeLines`: (Opcional) Número de linhas de contexto para mostrar antes de cada correspondência (como grep -B). Tem precedência sobre contextLines.
- `afterLines`: (Opcional) Número de linhas de contexto para mostrar depois de cada correspondência (como grep -A). Tem precedência sobre contextLines.
- `ignoreCase`: (Opcional, padrão: false) Realizar correspondência insensível a maiúsculas e minúsculas

**Funcionalidades:**
- Usa sintaxe JavaScript RegExp para correspondência de padrões poderosa
- Suporta linhas de contexto para melhor compreensão das correspondências
- Permite controle separado de linhas de contexto antes/depois
- Opções de busca sensível e insensível a maiúsculas e minúsculas

**Exemplo:**
```json
{
  "outputId": "8f7d3b1e2a9c6054",
  "pattern": "function\\s+\\w+\\(",
  "contextLines": 3,
  "ignoreCase": false
}
```

### file_system_read_file e file_system_read_directory

O servidor MCP do Repomix fornece duas ferramentas de sistema de arquivos que permitem que os assistentes de IA interajam com segurança com o sistema de arquivos local:

1. `file_system_read_file`
  - Lê conteúdo de arquivos do sistema de arquivos local usando caminhos absolutos
  - Inclui validação de segurança integrada para detectar e prevenir acesso a arquivos contendo informações sensíveis
  - Implementa validação de segurança usando [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint)
  - Previne acesso a arquivos contendo informações sensíveis (chaves de API, senhas, segredos)
  - Valida caminhos absolutos para prevenir ataques de travessia de diretórios
  - Retorna mensagens de erro claras para caminhos inválidos e problemas de segurança

2. `file_system_read_directory`
  - Lista conteúdos de um diretório usando um caminho absoluto
  - Retorna uma lista formatada mostrando arquivos e subdiretórios com indicadores claros
  - Mostra arquivos e diretórios com indicadores claros (`[FILE]` ou `[DIR]`)
  - Fornece navegação segura de diretórios com tratamento apropriado de erros
  - Valida caminhos e garante que sejam absolutos
  - Útil para explorar estrutura de projetos e compreender organização da base de código

Ambas as ferramentas incorporam medidas de segurança robustas:
- Validação de caminhos absolutos para prevenir ataques de travessia de diretórios
- Verificações de permissões para garantir direitos de acesso apropriados
- Integração com Secretlint para detecção de informações sensíveis
- Mensagens de erro claras para depuração e consciência de segurança

**Exemplo:**
```typescript
// Ler um arquivo
const fileContent = await tools.file_system_read_file({
  path: '/absolute/path/to/file.txt'
});

// Listar conteúdo do diretório
const dirContent = await tools.file_system_read_directory({
  path: '/absolute/path/to/directory'
});
```

Essas ferramentas são particularmente úteis quando os assistentes de IA precisam:
- Analisar arquivos específicos na base de código
- Navegar estruturas de diretórios
- Verificar existência e acessibilidade de arquivos
- Garantir operações seguras do sistema de arquivos

## Benefícios de Usar o Repomix como um Servidor MCP

Usar o Repomix como um servidor MCP oferece várias vantagens:

1. **Integração Direta**: Assistentes de IA podem analisar sua base de código diretamente sem preparação manual de arquivos.
2. **Fluxo de Trabalho Eficiente**: Otimiza o processo de análise de código eliminando a necessidade de gerar e carregar arquivos manualmente.
3. **Saída Consistente**: Garante que o assistente de IA receba a base de código em um formato consistente e otimizado.
4. **Recursos Avançados**: Aproveita todos os recursos do Repomix como compressão de código, contagem de tokens e verificações de segurança.

Uma vez configurado, seu assistente de IA pode usar diretamente as capacidades do Repomix para analisar bases de código, tornando os fluxos de trabalho de análise de código mais eficientes.

# Formatos de Saída

O Repomix suporta quatro formatos de saída:
- XML (padrão)
- Markdown
- JSON
- Texto simples 

## Formato XML

```bash
repomix --style xml
```

O formato XML é otimizado para processamento por IA:

```xml
Este arquivo é uma representação consolidada de toda a base de código...

<file_summary>
(Metadados e instruções para IA)
</file_summary>

<directory_structure>
src/
  index.ts
  utils/
    helper.ts
</directory_structure>

<files>
<file path="src/index.ts">
// Conteúdo do arquivo aqui
</file>

```

### Por que XML como formato padrão?

O Repomix usa XML como formato de saída padrão com base em pesquisas e testes extensivos. Esta decisão é fundamentada em evidências empíricas e considerações práticas para análise de código assistida por IA.

Nossa escolha do XML é principalmente influenciada por recomendações oficiais dos principais provedores de IA:
- **Anthropic (Claude)**: Recomenda explicitamente o uso de tags XML para estruturar prompts, afirmando que "Claude foi exposto a tais prompts durante o treinamento" ([documentação](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/use-xml-tags))
- **Google (Gemini)**: Recomenda formatos estruturados incluindo XML para tarefas complexas ([documentação](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/structure-prompts))
- **OpenAI (GPT)**: Defende o uso de prompting estruturado em cenários complexos ([anúncio](https://x.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1890147300493914437), [cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5_prompting_guide))

## Formato Markdown

```bash
repomix --style markdown
```

O Markdown oferece formatação legível:

````markdown
Este arquivo é uma representação consolidada de toda a base de código...

````

## Formato JSON

```bash
repomix --style json
```

O formato JSON fornece saída estruturada e programaticamente acessível com nomes de propriedades em camelCase:

```json
{
  "fileSummary": {
    "generationHeader": "Este arquivo é uma representação consolidada de toda a base de código, combinada em um único documento pelo Repomix.",
    "purpose": "Este arquivo contém uma representação empacotada do conteúdo completo do repositório...",
    "fileFormat": "O conteúdo está organizado da seguinte forma...",
    "usageGuidelines": "- Este arquivo deve ser tratado como somente leitura...",
    "notes": "- Alguns arquivos podem ter sido excluídos com base nas regras do .gitignore..."
  },
  "userProvidedHeader": "Texto de cabeçalho personalizado se especificado",
  "directoryStructure": "src/
  cli/
    cliOutput.ts
    index.ts
  config/
    configLoader.ts",
  "files": {
    "src/index.js": "// Conteúdo do arquivo aqui",
    "src/utils.js": "// Conteúdo do arquivo aqui"
  },
  "instruction": "Instruções personalizadas do instructionFilePath"
}
```

### Benefícios do Formato JSON

O formato JSON é ideal para:
- **Processamento programático**: Fácil de analisar e manipular com bibliotecas JSON em qualquer linguagem de programação
- **Integração de API**: Consumo direto por serviços web e aplicações
- **Compatibilidade com ferramentas de IA**: Formato estruturado otimizado para aprendizado de máquina e sistemas de IA
- **Análise de dados**: Extração direta de informações específicas usando ferramentas como `jq`

### Trabalhando com Saída JSON usando `jq`

O formato JSON facilita a extração programática de informações específicas. Aqui estão exemplos comuns:

#### Operações Básicas de Arquivos
```bash
# Listar todos os caminhos de arquivo
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[]'

# Contar o número total de arquivos
cat repomix-output.json | jq '.files | keys | length'

# Extrair conteúdo de arquivo específico
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files["README.md"]'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files["src/index.js"]'
```

#### Filtragem e Análise de Arquivos
```bash
# Encontrar arquivos por extensão
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(endswith(".ts"))'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(endswith(".js") or endswith(".ts"))'

# Obter arquivos contendo texto específico
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | select(.value | contains("function")) | .key'

# Criar lista de arquivos com contagem de caracteres
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | "\(.key): \(.value | length) caracteres"'
```

#### Extração de Metadados
```bash
# Extrair estrutura de diretórios
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.directoryStructure'

# Obter informações do resumo de arquivos
cat repomix-output.json | jq '.fileSummary.purpose'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.fileSummary.generationHeader'

# Extrair cabeçalho fornecido pelo usuário (se existir)
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.userProvidedHeader // "Nenhum cabeçalho fornecido"'

# Obter instruções personalizadas
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.instruction // "Nenhuma instrução fornecida"'
```

#### Análise Avançada
```bash
# Encontrar maiores arquivos por comprimento de conteúdo
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | [.key, (.value | length)] | @tsv' | sort -k2 -nr | head -10

# Pesquisar arquivos contendo padrões específicos
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | select(.value | test("import.*react"; "i")) | .key'

# Extrair caminhos de arquivos que coincidem com múltiplas extensões
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(test("\.(js|ts|jsx|tsx)$"))'
```

## Formato de Texto Simples

```bash
repomix --style plain
```

Estrutura de saída:
```text

## Uso com Modelos de IA

Cada formato funciona bem com modelos de IA, mas considere:
- Use XML para Claude (melhor precisão de análise)
- Use Markdown para leitura geral
- Use JSON para processamento programático e integração de API
- Use Texto Simples para simplicidade e compatibilidade universal

## Customização

Defina o formato padrão no `repomix.config.json`:
```json
{
  "output": {
    "style": "xml",
    "filePath": "output.xml"
  }
}
```

```bash
# Usando URL completo
repomix --remote https://github.com/user/repo

# Usando atalho do GitHub
repomix --remote user/repo
```

## Seleção de Branch e Commit

```bash
# Branch específico
repomix --remote user/repo --remote-branch main

# Tag
repomix --remote user/repo --remote-branch v1.0.0

# Hash do commit
repomix --remote user/repo --remote-branch 935b695
```

## Requisitos

- Git deve estar instalado
- Conexão com a internet
- Acesso de leitura ao repositório

## Controle de Saída

```bash
# Local de saída personalizado
repomix --remote user/repo -o custom-output.xml

# Com formato XML
repomix --remote user/repo --style xml

# Remover comentários
repomix --remote user/repo --remove-comments
```

## Uso com Docker

```bash
# Processar e enviar para o diretório atual
docker run -v .:/app -it --rm ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix \
  --remote user/repo

# Enviar para um diretório específico
docker run -v ./output:/app -it --rm ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix \
  --remote user/repo
```

## Problemas Comuns

### Problemas de Acesso
- Certifique-se de que o repositório é público
- Verifique a instalação do Git
- Verifique a conexão com a internet

`````

## File: website/client/src/pt-br/guide/security.md
`````markdown
# Segurança

## Recurso de Verificação de Segurança

O Repomix usa o [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint) para detectar informações confidenciais em seus arquivos:
- Chaves de API
- Tokens de acesso
- Credenciais
- Chaves privadas
- Variáveis de ambiente

## Configuração

As verificações de segurança são habilitadas por padrão.

Desativar via CLI:
```bash
repomix --no-security-check
```

Ou em `repomix.config.json`:
```json
{
  "security": {
    "enableSecurityCheck": false
  }
}
```

## Medidas de Segurança

1. **Tratamento de Arquivos Binários**: Os conteúdos de arquivos binários são excluídos da saída, mas seus caminhos são listados na estrutura de diretórios para uma visão completa do repositório
2. **Compatível com Git**: Respeita os padrões do `.gitignore`
3. **Detecção Automatizada**: Verifica problemas de segurança comuns:
    - Credenciais da AWS
    - Strings de conexão de banco de dados
    - Tokens de autenticação
    - Chaves privadas

## Quando a Verificação de Segurança Encontra Problemas

Exemplo de saída:
```bash
🔍 Verificação de Segurança:
──────────────────
2 arquivo(s) suspeito(s) detectados e excluídos:
1. config/credentials.json
  - Chave de acesso da AWS encontrada
2. .env.local
  - Senha do banco de dados encontrada
```

## Melhores Práticas

1. Sempre revise a saída antes de compartilhar
2. Use `.repomixignore` para caminhos confidenciais
3. Mantenha as verificações de segurança habilitadas
4. Remova arquivos confidenciais do repositório

## Reportando Problemas de Segurança

Encontrou uma vulnerabilidade de segurança? Por favor:
1. Não abra uma issue pública
2. Envie um e-mail para: koukun0120@gmail.com
3. Ou use [Avisos de Segurança do GitHub](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/security/advisories/new)

```

## Casos de Uso Comuns

### Compactar Diretórios Específicos
```bash
repomix path/to/directory
```

### Incluir Arquivos Específicos
Use [glob patterns](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax):
```bash
repomix --include "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md"
```

### Excluir Arquivos
```bash
repomix --ignore "**/*.log,tmp/"
```

### Repositórios Remotos
```bash
# Usando URL do GitHub
repomix --remote https://github.com/user/repo

# Usando abreviação
repomix --remote user/repo

# Branch/tag/commit específico
repomix --remote user/repo --remote-branch main
repomix --remote user/repo --remote-branch 935b695
```

### Entrada de Lista de Arquivos (stdin)

Passe caminhos de arquivos via stdin para máxima flexibilidade:

```bash
# Usando comando find
find src -name "*.ts" -type f | repomix --stdin

# Usando git para obter arquivos rastreados
git ls-files "*.ts" | repomix --stdin

# Usando ripgrep (rg) para encontrar arquivos
rg --files --type ts | repomix --stdin

# Usando grep para encontrar arquivos contendo conteúdo específico
grep -l "TODO" **/*.ts | repomix --stdin

# Usando ripgrep para encontrar arquivos com conteúdo específico
rg -l "TODO|FIXME" --type ts | repomix --stdin

# Usando sharkdp/fd para encontrar arquivos
fd -e ts | repomix --stdin

# Usando fzf para selecionar de todos os arquivos
fzf -m | repomix --stdin

# Seleção interativa de arquivos com fzf
find . -name "*.ts" -type f | fzf -m | repomix --stdin

# Usando ls com padrões glob
ls src/**/*.ts | repomix --stdin

# De um arquivo contendo caminhos de arquivos
cat file-list.txt | repomix --stdin

# Entrada direta com echo
echo -e "src/index.ts\nsrc/utils.ts" | repomix --stdin
```

A opção `--stdin` permite que você canalize uma lista de caminhos de arquivos para o Repomix, oferecendo máxima flexibilidade na seleção de quais arquivos compactar.

Ao usar `--stdin`, os arquivos especificados são efetivamente adicionados aos padrões de inclusão. Isso significa que o comportamento normal de inclusão e exclusão ainda se aplica - arquivos especificados via stdin ainda serão excluídos se coincidirem com padrões de exclusão.

> [!NOTE]
> Ao usar `--stdin`, os caminhos de arquivos podem ser relativos ou absolutos, e o Repomix tratará automaticamente da resolução de caminhos e deduplicação.

### Compressão de Código

```bash
repomix --compress

# Você também pode usar com repositórios remotos:
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix --compress
```

### Integração Git

Incluir informações do Git para fornecer contexto de desenvolvimento para análise de IA:

```bash
# Incluir diffs do git (alterações não commitadas)
repomix --include-diffs

# Incluir logs de commits do git (últimos 50 commits por padrão)
repomix --include-logs

# Incluir número específico de commits
repomix --include-logs --include-logs-count 10

# Incluir tanto diffs quanto logs
repomix --include-diffs --include-logs
```

Isso adiciona contexto valioso sobre:
- **Alterações recentes**: Diffs do Git mostram modificações não commitadas
- **Padrões de desenvolvimento**: Logs do Git revelam quais arquivos são tipicamente alterados juntos
- **Histórico de commits**: Mensagens de commits recentes fornecem insights sobre o foco do desenvolvimento
- **Relacionamentos entre arquivos**: Entender quais arquivos são modificados nos mesmos commits

### Otimização da Contagem de Tokens

Entender a distribuição de tokens da sua base de código é crucial para otimizar as interações com IA. Use a opção `--token-count-tree` para visualizar o uso de tokens em todo o seu projeto:

```bash
repomix --token-count-tree
```

Isso exibe uma visualização hierárquica da sua base de código com contagens de tokens:

```
🔢 Token Count Tree:
────────────────────
└── src/ (70,925 tokens)
    ├── cli/ (12,714 tokens)
    │   ├── actions/ (7,546 tokens)
    │   └── reporters/ (990 tokens)
    └── core/ (41,600 tokens)
        ├── file/ (10,098 tokens)
        └── output/ (5,808 tokens)
```

Você também pode definir um limite mínimo de tokens para focar em arquivos maiores:

```bash
repomix --token-count-tree 1000  # Mostrar apenas arquivos/diretórios com 1000+ tokens
```

Isso ajuda você a:
- **Identificar arquivos pesados em tokens** - que podem exceder os limites de contexto da IA
- **Otimizar a seleção de arquivos** - usando padrões `--include` e `--ignore`
- **Planejar estratégias de compressão** - direcionando os maiores contribuidores
- **Equilibrar conteúdo vs contexto** - ao preparar código para análise de IA

## 🏆 Indicação para os Open Source Awards

Estamos honrados! O Repomix foi indicado na categoria **Powered by AI** no [JSNation Open Source Awards 2025](https://osawards.com/javascript/).

Isso não teria sido possível sem todos vocês que usam e apoiam o Repomix. Obrigado!

## O que é o Repomix?

O Repomix é uma ferramenta poderosa que empacota toda a sua base de código em um único arquivo compatível com IA. Seja trabalhando em revisões de código, refatoração ou precisando de assistência de IA para seu projeto, o Repomix facilita o compartilhamento de todo o contexto do seu repositório com ferramentas de IA.

<YouTubeVideo :videoId="VIDEO_IDS.REPOMIX_DEMO" />

## Início Rápido

Depois de gerar um arquivo compactado (`repomix-output.xml`) usando o Repomix, você pode enviá-lo para um assistente de IA (como ChatGPT, Claude) com um prompt como:

```
Este arquivo contém todos os arquivos do repositório combinados em um.
Eu quero refatorar o código, então, por favor, revise-o primeiro.
```

A IA analisará todo o seu código-fonte e fornecerá insights abrangentes:

![Repomix File Usage 1](/images/docs/repomix-file-usage-1.png)

Ao discutir mudanças específicas, a IA pode ajudar a gerar código. Com recursos como o Artifacts do Claude, você pode até receber vários arquivos interdependentes:

![Repomix File Usage 2](/images/docs/repomix-file-usage-2.png)

Feliz codificação! 🚀

## Por que Repomix?

A força do Repomix reside em sua capacidade de trabalhar com serviços de assinatura como ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok sem se preocupar com custos, enquanto fornece contexto completo da base de código que elimina a necessidade de exploração de arquivos—tornando a análise mais rápida e frequentemente mais precisa.

Com toda a base de código disponível como contexto, o Repomix permite uma ampla gama de aplicações incluindo planejamento de implementação, investigação de bugs, verificações de segurança de bibliotecas de terceiros, geração de documentação e muito mais.

## Usando a Ferramenta CLI {#using-the-cli-tool}

O Repomix pode ser usado como uma ferramenta de linha de comando, oferecendo recursos poderosos e opções de personalização.

**A ferramenta CLI pode acessar repositórios privados** pois utiliza o Git instalado localmente.

### Início Rápido

Você pode experimentar o Repomix instantaneamente no diretório do seu projeto sem instalação:

```bash
npx repomix@latest
```

Ou instale globalmente para uso repetido:

```bash
# Instalar com npm
npm install -g repomix

# Ou com yarn
yarn global add repomix

# Ou com bun
bun add -g repomix

# Ou com Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
brew install repomix

# Então execute em qualquer diretório de projeto
repomix
```

É isso! O Repomix irá gerar um arquivo `repomix-output.xml` no seu diretório atual, contendo todo o seu repositório em um formato amigável para IA.

### Uso

Para compactar todo o seu repositório:

```bash
repomix
```

Para compactar um diretório específico:

```bash
repomix path/to/directory
```

Para compactar arquivos ou diretórios específicos usando [glob patterns](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax):

```bash
repomix --include "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md"
```

Para excluir arquivos ou diretórios específicos:

```bash
repomix --ignore "**/*.log,tmp/"
```

Para compactar um repositório remoto:
```bash
# Usando formato abreviado
npx repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix

# Usando URL completa (suporta branches e caminhos específicos)
npx repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix
npx repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/tree/main

# Usando URL do commit
npx repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/commit/836...
```

Para inicializar um novo arquivo de configuração (`repomix.config.json`):

```bash
repomix --init
```

Depois de gerar o arquivo compactado, você pode usá-lo com ferramentas de IA Generativa como Claude, ChatGPT e Gemini.

#### Uso do Docker

Você também pode executar o Repomix usando o Docker 🐳
Isso é útil se você quiser executar o Repomix em um ambiente isolado ou preferir usar contêineres.

Uso básico (diretório atual):

```bash
docker run -v .:/app -it --rm ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix
```

Para compactar um diretório específico:
```bash
docker run -v .:/app -it --rm ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix path/to/directory
```

Processar um repositório remoto e enviar para um diretório `output`:

```bash
docker run -v ./output:/app -it --rm ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix
```

### Formatos de Saída

Escolha seu formato de saída preferido:

```bash
# Formato XML (padrão)
repomix --style xml

# Formato Markdown
repomix --style markdown

# Formato JSON
repomix --style json

# Formato de texto simples
repomix --style plain
```

### Customização

Crie um `repomix.config.json` para configurações persistentes:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "style": "markdown",
    "filePath": "custom-output.md",
    "removeComments": true,
    "showLineNumbers": true,
    "topFilesLength": 10
  },
  "ignore": {
    "customPatterns": ["*.test.ts", "docs/**"]
  }
}
```

# Использование Repomix как библиотеки

Помимо использования Repomix как CLI-инструмента, вы можете интегрировать его функциональность напрямую в ваши Node.js-приложения.

## Установка

Установите Repomix как зависимость в вашем проекте:

```bash
npm install repomix
```

## Базовое использование

Самый простой способ использовать Repomix — через функцию `runCli`, которая предоставляет ту же функциональность, что и интерфейс командной строки:

```javascript
import { runCli, type CliOptions } from 'repomix';

// Обработка текущей директории с пользовательскими опциями
async function packProject() {
  const options = {
    output: 'output.xml',
    style: 'xml',
    compress: true,
    quiet: true
  } as CliOptions;

  const result = await runCli(['.'], process.cwd(), options);
  return result.packResult;
}
```

`result.packResult` содержит информацию об обработанных файлах, включая:
- `totalFiles`: Количество обработанных файлов
- `totalCharacters`: Общее количество символов
- `totalTokens`: Общее количество токенов (полезно для ограничений контекста LLM)
- `fileCharCounts`: Количество символов по файлам
- `fileTokenCounts`: Количество токенов по файлам

## Обработка удалённых репозиториев

Вы можете клонировать и обработать удалённый репозиторий:

```javascript
import { runCli, type CliOptions } from 'repomix';

// Клонировать и обработать GitHub-репозиторий
async function processRemoteRepo(repoUrl) {
  const options = {
    remote: repoUrl,
    output: 'output.xml',
    compress: true
  } as CliOptions;

  return await runCli(['.'], process.cwd(), options);
}
```

## Использование базовых компонентов

Для большего контроля вы можете использовать низкоуровневые API Repomix напрямую:

```javascript
import { searchFiles, collectFiles, processFiles, TokenCounter } from 'repomix';

async function analyzeFiles(directory) {
  // Найти и собрать файлы
  const { filePaths } = await searchFiles(directory, { /* config */ });
  const rawFiles = await collectFiles(filePaths, directory);
  const processedFiles = await processFiles(rawFiles, { /* config */ });

  // Подсчитать токены
  const tokenCounter = new TokenCounter('o200k_base');

  // Вернуть результаты анализа
  return processedFiles.map(file => ({
    path: file.path,
    tokens: tokenCounter.countTokens(file.content)
  }));
}
```

## Реальный пример

Сайт Repomix ([repomix.com](https://repomix.com)) использует Repomix как библиотеку для обработки удалённых репозиториев. Вы можете увидеть реализацию в [website/server/src/remoteRepo.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/....ts).

# Лучшие практики разработки с ИИ: Из моего опыта

Хотя мне пока не удалось успешно завершить крупномасштабный проект с использованием ИИ, я хотел бы поделиться тем, что узнал из своего опыта работы с ИИ в разработке.

## Базовый подход к разработке

При работе с ИИ попытка реализовать все функции сразу может привести к неожиданным проблемам и застою проекта. Поэтому более эффективно начинать с базовой функциональности и строить каждую функцию по очереди, обеспечивая надёжную реализацию перед продвижением вперёд.

### Сила существующего кода

Этот подход эффективен, потому что реализация базовой функциональности позволяет воплотить ваш идеальный дизайн и стиль кодирования в реальном коде. Самый эффективный способ донести ваше видение проекта — через код, который отражает ваши стандарты и предпочтения.

Начиная с основных функций и обеспечивая правильную работу каждого компонента перед переходом к следующему, весь проект поддерживает согласованность, что облегчает генерацию ИИ более подходящего кода.

## Модульный подход

Разбиение кода на небольшие модули критически важно. По моему опыту, поддержание файлов размером около 250 строк кода упрощает предоставление чётких инструкций ИИ и делает процесс проб и ошибок более эффективным. Хотя количество токенов было бы более точной метрикой, количество строк более практично для работы человека-разработчика, поэтому мы используем его как ориентир.

Эта модуляризация — не только разделение фронтенда, бэкенда и компонентов базы данных — это разбиение функциональности на гораздо более мелком уровне. Например, внутри одной функции вы можете выделить валидацию, обработку ошибок и другие специфические функциональности в отдельные модули. Конечно, высокоуровневое разделение тоже важно, и постепенная реализация этого модульного подхода помогает поддерживать чёткие инструкции и позволяет ИИ генерировать более подходящий код. Этот подход эффективен не только для ИИ, но и для человека-разработчика.

## Обеспечение качества через тестирование

Я считаю тестирование критически важным в разработке с помощью ИИ. Тесты служат не только мерой обеспечения качества, но и документацией, которая чётко демонстрирует намерения кода. При просьбе к ИИ реализовать новые функции существующий тестовый код эффективно действует как документ спецификации.

Тесты также являются отличным инструментом для проверки корректности кода, сгенерированного ИИ. Например, при просьбе к ИИ реализовать новую функциональность для модуля, предварительное написание тестовых случаев позволяет объективно оценить, ведёт ли сгенерированный код себя ожидаемым образом. Это хорошо согласуется с принципами разработки через тестирование (TDD) и особенно эффективно при работе с ИИ.

## Баланс между планированием и реализацией

Перед реализацией крупномасштабных функций я рекомендую сначала обсудить план с ИИ. Организация требований и обдумывание архитектуры ведёт к более плавной реализации. Хорошая практика — сначала собрать требования, а затем перейти в отдельную сессию чата для работы по реализации.

Важно иметь человеческую проверку вывода ИИ и вносить корректировки по мере необходимости. Хотя качество кода, сгенерированного ИИ, в целом умеренное, он всё равно ускоряет разработку по сравнению с написанием всего с нуля.

## Заключение

Следуя этим практикам, вы можете использовать сильные стороны ИИ, создавая при этом согласованную, высококачественную кодовую базу. Даже по мере роста размера проекта каждый компонент остаётся хорошо определённым и управляемым.

# Генерация Agent Skills

Repomix может генерировать вывод в формате [Claude Agent Skills](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills), создавая структурированную директорию Skills, которая может использоваться как переиспользуемый справочник кодовой базы для ИИ-ассистентов.

Эта функция особенно мощная, когда вы хотите ссылаться на реализации из удалённых репозиториев. Генерируя Skills из open source проектов, вы можете легко попросить Claude ссылаться на конкретные паттерны или реализации при работе над вашим собственным кодом.

Вместо генерации одного упакованного файла, генерация Skills создаёт структурированную директорию с несколькими справочными файлами, оптимизированными для понимания ИИ и поиска grep-ом.

> [!NOTE]
> Это экспериментальная функция. Формат вывода и опции могут измениться в будущих версиях на основе отзывов пользователей.

## Базовое использование

Генерация Skills из локальной директории:

```bash
# Генерация Skills из текущей директории
repomix --skill-generate

# Генерация с пользовательским именем Skills
repomix --skill-generate my-project-reference

# Генерация из конкретной директории
repomix path/to/directory --skill-generate

# Генерация из удалённого репозитория
repomix --remote https://github.com/user/repo --skill-generate
```

## Выбор расположения Skills

При запуске команды Repomix предложит выбрать, куда сохранить Skills:

1. **Персональные Skills** (`~/.claude/skills/`) — Доступны во всех проектах на вашем компьютере
2. **Проектные Skills** (`.claude/skills/`) — Доступны вашей команде через git

Если директория Skills уже существует, вам будет предложено подтвердить перезапись.

> [!TIP]
> При генерации проектных Skills рассмотрите добавление их в `.gitignore`, чтобы избежать коммита больших файлов:
> ```gitignore
> .claude/skills/repomix-reference-*/
> ```

## Генерируемая структура

Skills генерируются со следующей структурой:

```text
.claude/skills/<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md                    # Основные метаданные и документация Skills
└── references/
    ├── summary.md              # Назначение, формат и статистика
    ├── project-structure.md    # Дерево директорий с количеством строк
    ├── files.md                # Всё содержимое файлов (удобно для grep)
    └── tech-stack.md           # Языки, фреймворки, зависимости
```

### Описание файлов

#### SKILL.md

Основной файл Skills, содержащий:
- Имя Skills, описание и информацию о проекте
- Количество файлов, строк и токенов
- Обзор использования Skills
- Расположение файлов и объяснение формата
- Типичные сценарии использования и советы

#### references/summary.md

Содержит:
- **Назначение**: Объясняет, что это справочная кодовая база для потребления ИИ
- **Структура файлов**: Документирует, что находится в каждом справочном файле
- **Рекомендации по использованию**: Как эффективно использовать Skills
- **Статистика**: Разбивка по типу файла, языку и самым большим файлам

#### references/project-structure.md

Дерево директорий с количеством строк на файл для удобного обнаружения файлов:

```text
src/
  index.ts (42 lines)
  utils/
    helpers.ts (128 lines)
    math.ts (87 lines)
```

#### references/files.md

Всё содержимое файлов с заголовками подсветки синтаксиса, оптимизированное для поиска grep-ом:

````markdown
## File: src/index.ts
```typescript
import { sum } from './utils/helpers';

export function main() {
  console.log(sum(1, 2));
}
```
````

#### references/tech-stack.md

Автоматически определённый технологический стек из файлов зависимостей:
- **Языки**: TypeScript, JavaScript, Python и т.д.
- **Фреймворки**: React, Next.js, Express, Django и т.д.
- **Версии рантайма**: Node.js, Python, Go и т.д.
- **Пакетный менеджер**: npm, pnpm, poetry и т.д.
- **Зависимости**: Все прямые и dev-зависимости
- **Конфигурационные файлы**: Все обнаруженные файлы конфигурации

Определяется из файлов: `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `.nvmrc`, `pyproject.toml` и т.д.

## Автоматически генерируемые имена Skills

Если имя не указано, Repomix автоматически генерирует его по следующему паттерну:

```bash
repomix src/ --skill-generate                # → repomix-reference-src
repomix --remote user/repo --skill-generate  # → repomix-reference-repo
repomix --skill-generate CustomName          # → custom-name (нормализуется в kebab-case)
```

Имена Skills:
- Преобразуются в kebab-case (нижний регистр, разделены дефисами)
- Ограничены максимум 64 символами
- Защищены от обхода пути

## Интеграция с опциями Repomix

Генерация Skills учитывает все стандартные опции Repomix:

```bash
# Генерация Skills с фильтрацией файлов
repomix --skill-generate --include "src/**/*.ts" --ignore "**/*.test.ts"

# Генерация Skills со сжатием
repomix --skill-generate --compress

# Генерация Skills из удалённого репозитория
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix --skill-generate

# Генерация Skills с конкретными опциями формата вывода
repomix --skill-generate --remove-comments --remove-empty-lines
```

### Skills только с документацией

Используя `--include`, вы можете генерировать Skills, содержащие только документацию из GitHub-репозитория. Это полезно, когда вы хотите, чтобы Claude ссылался на конкретную документацию библиотеки или фреймворка при работе над вашим кодом:

```bash
# Документация Claude Code Action
repomix --remote https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action --include docs --skill-generate

# Документация Vite
repomix --remote https://github.com/vitejs/vite --include docs --skill-generate

# Документация React
repomix --remote https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev --include src/content --skill-generate
```

## Ограничения

Опция `--skill-generate` не может использоваться с:
- `--stdout` — Вывод Skills требует записи в файловую систему
- `--copy` — Вывод Skills — это директория, которую нельзя скопировать в буфер обмена

## Использование сгенерированных Skills

После генерации вы можете использовать Skills с Claude:

1. **Claude Code**: Skills автоматически доступны, если сохранены в `~/.claude/skills/` или `.claude/skills/`
2. **Claude Web**: Загрузите директорию Skills в Claude для анализа кодовой базы
3. **Командное использование**: Закоммитьте `.claude/skills/` в ваш репозиторий для доступа всей команды

## Пример рабочего процесса

### Создание персональной справочной библиотеки

```bash
# Клонировать и проанализировать интересный open source проект
repomix --remote facebook/react --skill-generate react-reference

# Skills сохранены в ~/.claude/skills/react-reference/
# Теперь вы можете ссылаться на кодовую базу React в любом разговоре с Claude
```

### Документация для команды проекта

```bash
# В директории вашего проекта
cd my-project

# Генерация Skills для вашей команды
repomix --skill-generate

# Выберите "Project Skills" при запросе
# Skills сохранены в .claude/skills/repomix-reference-my-project/

# Закоммитьте и поделитесь с командой
git add .claude/skills/
git commit -m "Add codebase reference Skills"
```

# Сжатие кода

Сжатие кода — это мощная функция, которая интеллектуально извлекает существенные структуры кода, удаляя детали реализации. Это особенно полезно для уменьшения количества токенов при сохранении важной структурной информации о вашей кодовой базе.

> [!NOTE]
> Это экспериментальная функция, которую мы будем активно улучшать на основе отзывов пользователей и реального использования

## Базовое использование

Включите сжатие кода с помощью флага `--compress`:

```bash
repomix --compress
```

Вы также можете использовать его с удалёнными репозиториями:

```bash
repomix --remote user/repo --compress
```

## Как это работает

Алгоритм сжатия обрабатывает код с помощью парсинга tree-sitter для извлечения и сохранения существенных структурных элементов при удалении деталей реализации.

Сжатие сохраняет:
- Сигнатуры функций и методов
- Определения интерфейсов и типов
- Структуры классов и свойства
- Важные структурные элементы

При этом удаляет:
- Реализации функций и методов
- Детали циклов и условной логики
- Внутренние объявления переменных
- Код, специфичный для реализации

### Пример

Оригинальный код TypeScript:

```typescript
import { ShoppingItem } from './shopping-item';

/**
 * Рассчитать общую стоимость товаров
 */
const calculateTotal = (
  items: ShoppingItem[]
) => {
  let total = 0;
  for (const item of items) {
    total += item.price * item.quantity;
  }
  return total;
}

// Интерфейс товара
interface Item {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  quantity: number;
}
```

После сжатия:

```typescript
import { ShoppingItem } from './shopping-item';
⋮----
/**
 * Рассчитать общую стоимость товаров
 */
const calculateTotal = (
  items: ShoppingItem[]
) => {
⋮----
// Интерфейс товара
interface Item {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  quantity: number;
}
```

## Конфигурация

Вы можете включить сжатие в файле конфигурации:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "compress": true
  }
}
```

## Сценарии использования

Сжатие кода особенно полезно, когда:
- Анализируете структуру и архитектуру кода
- Уменьшаете количество токенов для обработки LLM
- Создаёте высокоуровневую документацию
- Изучаете паттерны кода и сигнатуры
- Делитесь дизайном API и интерфейсов

## Связанные опции

Вы можете комбинировать сжатие с другими опциями:
- `--remove-comments`: Удаление комментариев кода
- `--remove-empty-lines`: Удаление пустых строк
- `--output-show-line-numbers`: Добавление номеров строк в вывод

## File: website/client/src/ru/guide/comment-removal.md
`````markdown
# Удаление комментариев

Repomix может автоматически удалять комментарии из вашей кодовой базы при генерации выходного файла. Это может помочь уменьшить шум и сосредоточиться на фактическом коде.

## Использование

Чтобы включить удаление комментариев, установите параметр `removeComments` в `true` в вашем `repomix.config.json`:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "removeComments": true
  }
}
```

## Поддерживаемые языки

Repomix поддерживает удаление комментариев для широкого спектра языков программирования, включая:

- JavaScript/TypeScript (`//`, `/* */`)
- Python (`#`, `"""`, `'''`)
- Java (`//`, `/* */`)
- C/C++ (`//`, `/* */`)
- HTML (`<!-- -->`)
- CSS (`/* */`)
- И многие другие...

## Пример

Для следующего JavaScript-кода:

```javascript
// Это однострочный комментарий
function test() {
  /* Это
     многострочный комментарий */
  return true;
}
```

С включённым удалением комментариев вывод будет:

```javascript
function test() {
  return true;
}
```

## Примечания

- Удаление комментариев выполняется до других этапов обработки, таких как добавление номеров строк.
- Некоторые комментарии, такие как комментарии JSDoc, могут быть сохранены в зависимости от языка и контекста.

# Конфигурация

Repomix можно настроить с помощью файла конфигурации или параметров командной строки. Файл конфигурации позволяет настраивать различные аспекты обработки и вывода вашей кодовой базы.

## Форматы файла конфигурации

Repomix поддерживает несколько форматов файлов конфигурации для гибкости и удобства использования.

Repomix автоматически ищет файлы конфигурации в следующем порядке приоритета:

1. **TypeScript** (`repomix.config.ts`, `repomix.config.mts`, `repomix.config.cts`)
2. **JavaScript/ES Module** (`repomix.config.js`, `repomix.config.mjs`, `repomix.config.cjs`)
3. **JSON** (`repomix.config.json5`, `repomix.config.jsonc`, `repomix.config.json`)

### Конфигурация JSON

Создайте файл конфигурации в директории вашего проекта:
```bash
repomix --init
```

Это создаст файл `repomix.config.json` с настройками по умолчанию. Вы также можете создать глобальный файл конфигурации, который будет использоваться как запасной, когда локальная конфигурация не найдена:

```bash
repomix --init --global
```

### Конфигурация TypeScript

Файлы конфигурации TypeScript предоставляют лучший опыт разработки с полной проверкой типов и поддержкой IDE.

**Установка:**

Чтобы использовать конфигурацию TypeScript или JavaScript с `defineConfig`, вам нужно установить Repomix как dev-зависимость:

```bash
npm install -D repomix
```

**Пример:**

```typescript
// repomix.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'repomix';

export default defineConfig({
  output: {
    filePath: 'output.xml',
    style: 'xml',
    removeComments: true,
  },
  ignore: {
    customPatterns: ['**/node_modules/**', '**/dist/**'],
  },
});
```

**Преимущества:**
- ✅ Полная проверка типов TypeScript в вашей IDE
- ✅ Отличное автодополнение и IntelliSense
- ✅ Использование динамических значений (временные метки, переменные окружения и т.д.)

**Пример с динамическими значениями:**

```typescript
// repomix.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'repomix';

// Генерация имени файла на основе временной метки
const timestamp = new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 19).replace(/[:.]/g, '-');

export default defineConfig({
  output: {
    filePath: `output-${timestamp}.xml`,
    style: 'xml',
  },
});
```

### Конфигурация JavaScript

Файлы конфигурации JavaScript работают так же, как TypeScript, поддерживая `defineConfig` и динамические значения.

## Параметры конфигурации

| Параметр                         | Описание                                                                                                                      | По умолчанию           |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| `input.maxFileSize`              | Максимальный размер файла в байтах для обработки. Файлы больше этого значения будут пропущены. Полезно для исключения больших бинарных или data-файлов | `50000000`            |
| `output.filePath`                | Имя выходного файла. Поддерживает форматы XML, Markdown и простой текст                                                        | `"repomix-output.xml"` |
| `output.style`                   | Стиль вывода (`xml`, `markdown`, `json`, `plain`). Каждый формат имеет свои преимущества для разных ИИ-инструментов            | `"xml"`                |

| `output.fileSummary`             | Включать ли раздел сводки в начале с количеством файлов, размерами и другими метриками                                         | `true`                 |
| `output.directoryStructure`      | Включать ли структуру директорий в вывод. Помогает ИИ понять организацию проекта                                               | `true`                 |
| `output.files`                   | Включать ли содержимое файлов в вывод. Установите false для включения только структуры и метаданных                            | `true`                 |
| `output.removeComments`          | Удалять ли комментарии из поддерживаемых типов файлов. Может уменьшить шум и количество токенов                                | `false`                |
| `output.removeEmptyLines`        | Удалять ли пустые строки из вывода для уменьшения количества токенов                                                           | `false`                |
| `output.showLineNumbers`         | Добавлять ли номера строк к каждой строке. Полезно для ссылок на конкретные части кода                                         | `false`                |
| `output.truncateBase64`          | Обрезать ли длинные строки base64-данных (например, изображения) для уменьшения количества токенов                             | `false`                |
| `output.copyToClipboard`         | Копировать ли вывод в системный буфер обмена помимо сохранения файла                                                           | `false`                |
| `output.topFilesLength`          | Количество топ-файлов для отображения в сводке. Если установлено 0, сводка не будет отображаться                               | `5`                    |
| `output.includeEmptyDirectories` | Включать ли пустые директории в структуру репозитория                                                                          | `false`                |
| `output.includeFullDirectoryStructure` | При использовании паттернов `include` отображать ли полное дерево директорий (с учётом паттернов игнорирования), обрабатывая только включённые файлы. Предоставляет полный контекст репозитория для анализа ИИ | `false`                |
| `output.git.sortByChanges`       | Сортировать ли файлы по количеству изменений в git. Файлы с большим количеством изменений появляются внизу                      | `true`                 |
| `output.git.sortByChangesMaxCommits` | Максимальное количество коммитов для анализа изменений git. Ограничивает глубину истории для производительности             | `100`                  |

Файл конфигурации поддерживает синтаксис [JSON5](https://json5.org/), который позволяет:
- Комментарии (как однострочные, так и многострочные)
- Завершающие запятые в объектах и массивах
- Имена свойств без кавычек
- Более гибкий синтаксис строк

## Валидация схемы

Вы можете включить валидацию схемы для вашего файла конфигурации, добавив свойство `$schema`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://repomix.com/schemas/latest/schema.json",
  "output": {
    "filePath": "repomix-output.xml",
    "style": "xml"
  }
}
```

Это обеспечивает автодополнение и валидацию в редакторах, поддерживающих JSON-схему.

## Пример файла конфигурации

Вот пример полного файла конфигурации (`repomix.config.json`):

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://repomix.com/schemas/latest/schema.json",
  "input": {
    "maxFileSize": 50000000
  },
  "output": {
    "filePath": "repomix-output.xml",
    "style": "xml",

## Расположение файлов конфигурации

Repomix ищет файлы конфигурации в следующем порядке:
1. Локальный файл конфигурации в текущей директории (порядок приоритета: TS > JS > JSON)
   - TypeScript: `repomix.config.ts`, `repomix.config.mts`, `repomix.config.cts`
   - JavaScript: `repomix.config.js`, `repomix.config.mjs`, `repomix.config.cjs`
   - JSON: `repomix.config.json5`, `repomix.config.jsonc`, `repomix.config.json`
2. Глобальный файл конфигурации (порядок приоритета: TS > JS > JSON)
   - Windows:
     - TypeScript: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.ts`, `.mts`, `.cts`
     - JavaScript: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`
     - JSON: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.json5`, `.jsonc`, `.json`
   - macOS/Linux:
     - TypeScript: `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.ts`, `.mts`, `.cts`
     - JavaScript: `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`
     - JSON: `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.json5`, `.jsonc`, `.json`

Параметры командной строки имеют приоритет над настройками файла конфигурации.

## Паттерны включения

Repomix поддерживает указание файлов для включения с помощью [glob-паттернов](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax). Это позволяет более гибко и мощно выбирать файлы:

- Используйте `**/*.js` для включения всех JavaScript-файлов в любой директории
- Используйте `src/**/*` для включения всех файлов в директории `src` и её поддиректориях
- Комбинируйте несколько паттернов, например `["src/**/*.js", "**/*.md"]` для включения JavaScript-файлов в `src` и всех Markdown-файлов

Вы можете указать паттерны включения в файле конфигурации:

```json
{
  "include": ["src/**/*", "tests/**/*.test.js"]
}
```

Или используйте параметр командной строки `--include` для одноразовой фильтрации.

## Паттерны игнорирования

Repomix предлагает несколько методов для установки паттернов игнорирования для исключения конкретных файлов или директорий в процессе упаковки:

- **.gitignore**: По умолчанию используются паттерны из файлов `.gitignore` вашего проекта и `.git/info/exclude`. Это поведение можно контролировать с помощью настройки `ignore.useGitignore` или параметра CLI `--no-gitignore`.
- **.ignore**: Вы можете использовать файл `.ignore` в корне проекта, следуя тому же формату, что и `.gitignore`. Этот файл учитывается такими инструментами, как ripgrep и silver searcher, что уменьшает необходимость поддерживать несколько файлов игнорирования. Это поведение можно контролировать с помощью настройки `ignore.useDotIgnore` или параметра CLI `--no-dot-ignore`.
- **Паттерны по умолчанию**: Repomix включает список по умолчанию часто исключаемых файлов и директорий (например, node_modules, .git, бинарные файлы). Эту функцию можно контролировать с помощью настройки `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` или параметра CLI `--no-default-patterns`. Подробнее см. [defaultIgnore.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/src/config/defaultIgnore.ts).
- **.repomixignore**: Вы можете создать файл `.repomixignore` в корне проекта для определения паттернов игнорирования, специфичных для Repomix. Этот файл следует тому же формату, что и `.gitignore`.
- **Пользовательские паттерны**: Дополнительные паттерны игнорирования можно указать с помощью параметра `ignore.customPatterns` в файле конфигурации. Вы можете переопределить эту настройку с помощью параметра командной строки `-i, --ignore`.

**Порядок приоритета** (от высшего к низшему):

1. Пользовательские паттерны (`ignore.customPatterns`)
2. Файлы игнорирования (`.repomixignore`, `.ignore`, `.gitignore` и `.git/info/exclude`):
   - Во вложенных директориях файлы в более глубоких директориях имеют более высокий приоритет
   - В одной директории эти файлы объединяются без определённого порядка
3. Паттерны по умолчанию (если `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` равно true и `--no-default-patterns` не используется)

Этот подход позволяет гибко настраивать исключение файлов в соответствии с потребностями вашего проекта. Это помогает оптимизировать размер сгенерированного упакованного файла, обеспечивая исключение файлов, чувствительных к безопасности, и больших бинарных файлов, предотвращая утечку конфиденциальной информации.

**Примечание:** Бинарные файлы не включаются в упакованный вывод по умолчанию, но их пути перечислены в разделе «Repository Structure» выходного файла. Это обеспечивает полный обзор структуры репозитория, сохраняя упакованный файл эффективным и текстовым. См. [Обработка бинарных файлов](#обработка-бинарных-файлов) для подробностей.

Пример `.repomixignore`:
```text
# Директории кэша
.cache/
tmp/

# Выходные файлы сборки
dist/
build/

# Логи
*.log
```

## Паттерны игнорирования по умолчанию

Когда `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` равно true, Repomix автоматически игнорирует типичные паттерны:
```text
node_modules/**
.git/**
coverage/**
dist/**
```

Полный список см. в [defaultIgnore.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/src/config/defaultIgnore.ts)

## Обработка бинарных файлов

Бинарные файлы (такие как изображения, PDF, скомпилированные бинарники, архивы и т.д.) обрабатываются особым образом для поддержания эффективного текстового вывода:

- **Содержимое файлов**: Бинарные файлы **не включаются** в упакованный вывод, чтобы сохранить файл текстовым и эффективным для обработки ИИ
- **Структура директорий**: **Пути бинарных файлов перечислены** в разделе структуры директорий, предоставляя полный обзор вашего репозитория

Этот подход обеспечивает полный обзор структуры вашего репозитория, сохраняя эффективный текстовый вывод, оптимизированный для потребления ИИ.

**Пример:**

Если ваш репозиторий содержит `logo.png` и `app.jar`:
- Они появятся в разделе Directory Structure
- Их содержимое не будет включено в раздел Files

**Вывод структуры директорий:**
```
src/
  index.ts
  utils.ts
assets/
  logo.png
build/
  app.jar
```

Таким образом, ИИ-инструменты могут понять, что эти бинарные файлы существуют в структуре вашего проекта, не обрабатывая их бинарное содержимое.

**Примечание:** Вы можете контролировать максимальный порог размера файла с помощью параметра конфигурации `input.maxFileSize` (по умолчанию: 50 МБ). Файлы больше этого лимита будут полностью пропущены.

## Продвинутые возможности

### Сжатие кода

Функция сжатия кода, включаемая с помощью `output.compress: true`, использует [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) для интеллектуального извлечения существенных структур кода при удалении деталей реализации. Это помогает уменьшить количество токенов, сохраняя важную структурную информацию.

Ключевые преимущества:
- Значительное уменьшение количества токенов
- Сохранение сигнатур классов и функций
- Сохранение импортов и экспортов
- Сохранение определений типов и интерфейсов
- Удаление тел функций и деталей реализации

Подробнее и примеры см. в [Руководстве по сжатию кода](code-compress).

### Интеграция с Git

Конфигурация `output.git` предоставляет мощные функции, учитывающие Git:

- `sortByChanges`: Когда true, файлы сортируются по количеству изменений Git (коммитов, изменивших файл). Файлы с большим количеством изменений появляются внизу вывода. Это помогает приоритизировать более активно разрабатываемые файлы. По умолчанию: `true`
- `sortByChangesMaxCommits`: Максимальное количество коммитов для анализа при подсчёте изменений файлов. По умолчанию: `100`
- `includeDiffs`: Когда true, включает различия Git в вывод (включает изменения рабочего дерева и staged отдельно). Это позволяет видеть ожидающие изменения в репозитории. По умолчанию: `false`
- `includeLogs`: Когда true, включает историю Git-коммитов в вывод. Показывает даты коммитов, сообщения и пути файлов для каждого коммита. Это помогает ИИ понимать паттерны разработки и связи файлов. По умолчанию: `false`
- `includeLogsCount`: Количество последних коммитов для включения в git-логи. По умолчанию: `50`

Пример конфигурации:
```json
{
  "output": {
    "git": {
      "sortByChanges": true,
      "sortByChangesMaxCommits": 100,
      "includeDiffs": true,
      "includeLogs": true,
      "includeLogsCount": 25
    }
  }
}
```

### Проверки безопасности

Когда `security.enableSecurityCheck` включен, Repomix использует [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint) для обнаружения конфиденциальной информации в вашей кодовой базе перед включением её в вывод. Это помогает предотвратить случайное раскрытие:

- API-ключей
- Токенов доступа
- Приватных ключей
- Паролей
- Других конфиденциальных учётных данных

### Удаление комментариев

Когда `output.removeComments` установлено в `true`, комментарии удаляются из поддерживаемых типов файлов для уменьшения размера вывода и фокусировки на существенном содержимом кода. Это может быть особенно полезно, когда:

- Работаете с сильно документированным кодом
- Пытаетесь уменьшить количество токенов
- Фокусируетесь на структуре и логике кода

Поддерживаемые языки и подробные примеры см. в [Руководстве по удалению комментариев](comment-removal).

## File: website/client/src/ru/guide/custom-instructions.md
`````markdown
# Пользовательские инструкции

Repomix позволяет предоставлять пользовательские инструкции, которые будут включены в выходной файл. Это может быть полезно для добавления контекста или конкретных рекомендаций для ИИ-систем, обрабатывающих репозиторий.

## Использование

Чтобы включить пользовательскую инструкцию, создайте markdown-файл (например, `repomix-instruction.md`) в корне вашего репозитория. Затем укажите путь к этому файлу в вашем `repomix.config.json`:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "instructionFilePath": "repomix-instruction.md"
  }
}
```

Содержимое этого файла будет включено в вывод в разделе «Instruction».

## Пример

```markdown
# Инструкции для репозитория

Этот репозиторий содержит исходный код инструмента Repomix. Пожалуйста, следуйте этим рекомендациям при анализе кода:

1. Сосредоточьтесь на основной функциональности в директории `src/core`.
2. Обратите особое внимание на проверки безопасности в `src/core/security`.
3. Игнорируйте все файлы в директории `tests`.
```

Это приведёт к следующему разделу в выводе:

```xml
<instruction>
# Инструкции для репозитория

Этот репозиторий содержит исходный код инструмента Repomix. Пожалуйста, следуйте этим рекомендациям при анализе кода:

1. Сосредоточьтесь на основной функциональности в директории `src/core`.
2. Обратите особое внимание на проверки безопасности в `src/core/security`.
3. Игнорируйте все файлы в директории `tests`.
</instruction>
```

## File: website/client/src/ru/guide/github-actions.md
`````markdown
# Использование Repomix с GitHub Actions

Вы можете автоматизировать процесс упаковки вашей кодовой базы для анализа ИИ, интегрировав Repomix в рабочие процессы GitHub Actions. Это полезно для непрерывной интеграции (CI), код-ревью или подготовки репозитория для инструментов на основе LLM.

## Базовое использование

Добавьте следующий шаг в ваш workflow YAML для упаковки репозитория:

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    output: repomix-output.xml
```

## Использование различных форматов вывода

Вы можете указать различные форматы вывода с помощью параметра `style` (по умолчанию `xml`):

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    output: repomix-output.md
    style: markdown
```

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix (JSON format)
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    output: repomix-output.json
    style: json
```

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix (Plain text format)
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    output: repomix-output.txt
    style: plain
```

## Упаковка нескольких директорий со сжатием

Вы можете указать несколько директорий, паттерны включения/исключения и включить умное сжатие:

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    directories: src tests
    include: "**/*.ts,**/*.md"
    ignore: "**/*.test.ts"
    output: repomix-output.xml
    compress: true
```

## Загрузка вывода как артефакта

Чтобы сделать упакованный файл доступным для последующих шагов workflow или для скачивания, загрузите его как артефакт:

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    directories: src
    output: repomix-output.xml
    compress: true

- name: Upload Repomix output
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: repomix-output
    path: repomix-output.xml
```

## Входные параметры Action

# MCP-сервер

Repomix поддерживает [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), позволяя ИИ-ассистентам напрямую взаимодействовать с вашей кодовой базой. При запуске в качестве MCP-сервера Repomix предоставляет инструменты, которые позволяют ИИ-ассистентам упаковывать локальные или удалённые репозитории для анализа без необходимости ручной подготовки файлов.

> [!NOTE]
> Это экспериментальная функция, которую мы будем активно улучшать на основе отзывов пользователей и реального использования

## Запуск Repomix как MCP-сервера

Для запуска Repomix в качестве MCP-сервера используйте флаг `--mcp`:

```bash
repomix --mcp
```

Это запускает Repomix в режиме MCP-сервера, делая его доступным для ИИ-ассистентов, поддерживающих Model Context Protocol.

## Настройка MCP-серверов

Для использования Repomix в качестве MCP-сервера с ИИ-ассистентами, такими как Claude, вам нужно настроить параметры MCP:

### Для VS Code

Вы можете установить MCP-сервер Repomix в VS Code одним из следующих способов:

1. **Используя значок установки:**

  [![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-VS_Code?style=flat-square&label=Install%20Server&color=0098FF)](vscode:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22repomix%22%2C%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22repomix%22%2C%22--mcp%22%5D%7D)<br>
  [![Install in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-VS_Code_Insiders?style=flat-square&label=Install%20Server&color=24bfa5)](vscode-insiders:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22repomix%22%2C%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22repomix%22%2C%22--mcp%22%5D%7D)

2. **Используя командную строку:**

  ```bash
  code --add-mcp '{"name":"repomix","command":"npx","args":["-y","repomix","--mcp"]}'
  ```

  Для VS Code Insiders:
  ```bash
  code-insiders --add-mcp '{"name":"repomix","command":"npx","args":["-y","repomix","--mcp"]}'
  ```

### Для Cline (расширение VS Code)

Отредактируйте файл `cline_mcp_settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "repomix": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "repomix",
        "--mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Для Cursor

В Cursor добавьте новый MCP-сервер из `Cursor Settings` > `MCP` > `+ Add new global MCP server` с конфигурацией, аналогичной Cline.

### Для Claude Desktop

Отредактируйте файл `claude_desktop_config.json` с конфигурацией, аналогичной конфигурации Cline.

### Для Claude Code

Настройте Repomix как MCP-сервер в [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview) с помощью следующей команды:

```bash
claude mcp add repomix -- npx -y repomix --mcp
```

Альтернативно вы можете использовать **официальные плагины Repomix** для более удобного опыта. Плагины предоставляют команды на естественном языке и упрощённую настройку. Подробнее см. в документации [Плагины Claude Code](/ru/guide/claude-code-plugins).

### Использование Docker вместо npx

Вместо npx вы также можете использовать Docker для запуска Repomix в качестве MCP-сервера:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "repomix-docker": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix",
        "--mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Доступные MCP-инструменты

При запуске в качестве MCP-сервера Repomix предоставляет следующие инструменты:

### pack_codebase

Этот инструмент упаковывает локальную директорию кода в консолидированный XML-файл для анализа ИИ. Он анализирует структуру кодовой базы, извлекает релевантное содержимое кода и генерирует комплексный отчёт, включающий метрики, дерево файлов и отформатированное содержимое кода.

**Параметры:**
- `directory`: (Обязательный) Абсолютный путь к директории для упаковки
- `compress`: (Опциональный, по умолчанию: false) Включить сжатие Tree-sitter для извлечения существенных сигнатур и структуры кода при удалении деталей реализации. Уменьшает использование токенов на ~70%, сохраняя семантическое значение. Обычно не требуется, так как grep_repomix_output позволяет инкрементальное получение содержимого. Используйте только когда вам конкретно нужно всё содержимое кодовой базы для больших репозиториев.
- `includePatterns`: (Опциональный) Указать файлы для включения с помощью паттернов fast-glob. Несколько паттернов можно разделить запятыми (например, "**/*.{js,ts}", "src/**,docs/**"). Будут обработаны только соответствующие файлы.
- `ignorePatterns`: (Опциональный) Указать дополнительные файлы для исключения с помощью паттернов fast-glob. Несколько паттернов можно разделить запятыми (например, "test/**,*.spec.js", "node_modules/**,dist/**"). Эти паттерны дополняют .gitignore и встроенные исключения.
- `topFilesLength`: (Опциональный, по умолчанию: 10) Количество самых больших файлов по размеру для отображения в сводке метрик для анализа кодовой базы.

**Пример:**
```json
{
  "directory": "/path/to/your/project",
  "compress": false,
  "includePatterns": "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md",
  "ignorePatterns": "**/*.log,tmp/",
  "topFilesLength": 10
}
```

### pack_remote_repository

Этот инструмент получает, клонирует и упаковывает GitHub-репозиторий в консолидированный XML-файл для анализа ИИ. Он автоматически клонирует удалённый репозиторий, анализирует его структуру и генерирует комплексный отчёт.

**Параметры:**
- `remote`: (Обязательный) URL GitHub-репозитория или формат user/repo (например, `yamadashy/repomix`, `https://github.com/user/repo` или `https://github.com/user/repo/tree/branch`)
- `compress`: (Опциональный, по умолчанию: false) Включить сжатие Tree-sitter для извлечения существенных сигнатур и структуры кода при удалении деталей реализации. Уменьшает использование токенов на ~70%, сохраняя семантическое значение. Обычно не требуется, так как grep_repomix_output позволяет инкрементальное получение содержимого. Используйте только когда вам конкретно нужно всё содержимое кодовой базы для больших репозиториев.
- `includePatterns`: (Опциональный) Указать файлы для включения с помощью паттернов fast-glob. Несколько паттернов можно разделить запятыми (например, "**/*.{js,ts}", "src/**,docs/**"). Будут обработаны только соответствующие файлы.
- `ignorePatterns`: (Опциональный) Указать дополнительные файлы для исключения с помощью паттернов fast-glob. Несколько паттернов можно разделить запятыми (например, "test/**,*.spec.js", "node_modules/**,dist/**"). Эти паттерны дополняют .gitignore и встроенные исключения.
- `topFilesLength`: (Опциональный, по умолчанию: 10) Количество самых больших файлов по размеру для отображения в сводке метрик для анализа кодовой базы.

**Пример:**
```json
{
  "remote": "yamadashy/repomix",
  "compress": false,
  "includePatterns": "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md",
  "ignorePatterns": "**/*.log,tmp/",
  "topFilesLength": 10
}
```

### read_repomix_output

Этот инструмент читает содержимое выходного файла, сгенерированного Repomix. Поддерживает частичное чтение с указанием диапазона строк для больших файлов. Этот инструмент предназначен для сред, где прямой доступ к файловой системе ограничен.

**Параметры:**
- `outputId`: (Обязательный) ID выходного файла Repomix для чтения
- `startLine`: (Опциональный) Начальный номер строки (с 1, включительно). Если не указан, читает с начала.
- `endLine`: (Опциональный) Конечный номер строки (с 1, включительно). Если не указан, читает до конца.

**Возможности:**
- Специально разработан для веб-сред или изолированных приложений
- Извлекает содержимое ранее сгенерированных выходных файлов по их ID
- Обеспечивает безопасный доступ к упакованной кодовой базе без необходимости доступа к файловой системе
- Поддерживает частичное чтение для больших файлов

**Пример:**
```json
{
  "outputId": "8f7d3b1e2a9c6054",
  "startLine": 100,
  "endLine": 200
}
```

### grep_repomix_output

Этот инструмент ищет паттерны в выходном файле Repomix с использованием функциональности grep с синтаксисом JavaScript RegExp. Возвращает совпадающие строки с опциональными контекстными строками вокруг совпадений.

**Параметры:**
- `outputId`: (Обязательный) ID выходного файла Repomix для поиска
- `pattern`: (Обязательный) Паттерн поиска (синтаксис регулярных выражений JavaScript RegExp)
- `contextLines`: (Опциональный, по умолчанию: 0) Количество контекстных строк для показа до и после каждого совпадения. Переопределяется beforeLines/afterLines, если указаны.
- `beforeLines`: (Опциональный) Количество контекстных строк для показа перед каждым совпадением (как grep -B). Имеет приоритет над contextLines.
- `afterLines`: (Опциональный) Количество контекстных строк для показа после каждого совпадения (как grep -A). Имеет приоритет над contextLines.
- `ignoreCase`: (Опциональный, по умолчанию: false) Выполнять поиск без учёта регистра

**Возможности:**
- Использует синтаксис JavaScript RegExp для мощного сопоставления паттернов
- Поддерживает контекстные строки для лучшего понимания совпадений
- Позволяет отдельно контролировать контекстные строки до/после
- Опции поиска с учётом и без учёта регистра

**Пример:**
```json
{
  "outputId": "8f7d3b1e2a9c6054",
  "pattern": "function\\s+\\w+\\(",
  "contextLines": 3,
  "ignoreCase": false
}
```

### file_system_read_file и file_system_read_directory

MCP-сервер Repomix предоставляет два инструмента файловой системы, которые позволяют ИИ-ассистентам безопасно взаимодействовать с локальной файловой системой:

1. `file_system_read_file`
  - Читает содержимое файла из локальной файловой системы по абсолютному пути
  - Включает встроенную проверку безопасности для обнаружения и предотвращения доступа к файлам с конфиденциальной информацией
  - Реализует проверку безопасности с помощью [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint)
  - Предотвращает доступ к файлам с конфиденциальной информацией (API-ключи, пароли, секреты)
  - Проверяет абсолютные пути для предотвращения атак обхода директорий
  - Возвращает отформатированное содержимое с понятными сообщениями об ошибках для недопустимых путей или проблем безопасности

2. `file_system_read_directory`
  - Выводит содержимое директории по абсолютному пути
  - Возвращает отформатированный список, показывающий файлы и поддиректории с понятными индикаторами
  - Показывает файлы и директории с понятными индикаторами (`[FILE]` или `[DIR]`)
  - Обеспечивает безопасный обход директорий с правильной обработкой ошибок
  - Проверяет пути и гарантирует, что они абсолютные
  - Полезно для изучения структуры проекта и понимания организации кодовой базы

Оба инструмента включают надёжные меры безопасности:
- Проверка абсолютных путей для предотвращения атак обхода директорий
- Проверки прав доступа для обеспечения правильных прав
- Интеграция с Secretlint для обнаружения конфиденциальной информации
- Понятные сообщения об ошибках для лучшей отладки и осведомлённости о безопасности

**Пример:**
```typescript
// Чтение файла
const fileContent = await tools.file_system_read_file({
  path: '/absolute/path/to/file.txt'
});

// Вывод содержимого директории
const dirContent = await tools.file_system_read_directory({
  path: '/absolute/path/to/directory'
});
```

Эти инструменты особенно полезны, когда ИИ-ассистентам нужно:
- Анализировать конкретные файлы в кодовой базе
- Навигировать по структурам директорий
- Проверять существование и доступность файлов
- Обеспечивать безопасные операции с файловой системой

## Преимущества использования Repomix как MCP-сервера

Использование Repomix в качестве MCP-сервера предлагает несколько преимуществ:

1. **Прямая интеграция**: ИИ-ассистенты могут напрямую анализировать вашу кодовую базу без ручной подготовки файлов.
2. **Эффективный рабочий процесс**: Оптимизирует процесс анализа кода, устраняя необходимость вручную генерировать и загружать файлы.
3. **Согласованный вывод**: Гарантирует, что ИИ-ассистент получает кодовую базу в согласованном, оптимизированном формате.
4. **Продвинутые функции**: Использует все возможности Repomix, такие как сжатие кода, подсчёт токенов и проверки безопасности.

После настройки ваш ИИ-ассистент может напрямую использовать возможности Repomix для анализа кодовых баз, делая рабочие процессы анализа кода более эффективными.

# Форматы вывода

Repomix поддерживает четыре формата вывода:
- XML (по умолчанию)
- Markdown
- JSON
- Простой текст

## Формат XML

```bash
repomix --style xml
```

Формат XML оптимизирован для обработки ИИ:

```xml
This file is a merged representation of the entire codebase...

<file_summary>
(Метаданные и инструкции для ИИ)
</file_summary>

<directory_structure>
src/
  index.ts
  utils/
    helper.ts
</directory_structure>

<files>
<file path="src/index.ts">
// Содержимое файла здесь
</file>
</files>

</git_logs>
```

### Почему XML является форматом по умолчанию?
Repomix использует XML в качестве формата вывода по умолчанию на основе обширных исследований и тестирования. Это решение основано как на эмпирических данных, так и на практических соображениях для анализа кода с помощью ИИ.

Наш выбор XML в первую очередь обусловлен официальными рекомендациями крупных поставщиков ИИ:
- **Anthropic (Claude)**: Явно рекомендует XML-теги для структурирования промптов, заявляя, что «Claude подвергался таким промптам во время обучения» ([источник](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/use-xml-tags))
- **Google (Gemini)**: Рекомендует структурированные форматы, включая XML, для сложных задач ([документация](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/structure-prompts))
- **OpenAI (GPT)**: Выступает за структурированные промпты в сложных сценариях ([анонс](https://x.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1890147300493914437), [cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5_prompting_guide))

## Формат Markdown

```bash
repomix --style markdown
```

Markdown обеспечивает читаемое форматирование:

````markdown
This file is a merged representation of the entire codebase...

# File Summary
(Метаданные и инструкции для ИИ)

# Directory Structure
```
src/
index.ts
utils/
helper.ts
```

```
````

## Формат JSON

```bash
repomix --style json
```

Формат JSON предоставляет структурированный, программно доступный вывод с именами свойств в camelCase:

```json
{
  "fileSummary": {
    "generationHeader": "This file is a merged representation of the entire codebase, combined into a single document by Repomix.",
    "purpose": "This file contains a packed representation of the entire repository's contents...",
    "fileFormat": "The content is organized as follows...",
    "usageGuidelines": "- This file should be treated as read-only...",
    "notes": "- Some files may have been excluded based on .gitignore rules..."
  },
  "userProvidedHeader": "Custom header text if specified",
  "directoryStructure": "src/
  cli/
    cliOutput.ts
    index.ts
  config/
    configLoader.ts",
  "files": {
    "src/index.js": "// Содержимое файла здесь",
    "src/utils.js": "// Содержимое файла здесь"
  },
  "instruction": "Custom instructions from instructionFilePath"
}
```

### Преимущества формата JSON

Формат JSON идеален для:
- **Программной обработки**: Легко парсить и манипулировать с помощью JSON-библиотек на любом языке программирования
- **Интеграции с API**: Прямое потребление веб-сервисами и приложениями
- **Совместимости с ИИ-инструментами**: Структурированный формат, оптимизированный для систем машинного обучения и ИИ
- **Анализа данных**: Простое извлечение конкретной информации с помощью таких инструментов, как `jq`

### Работа с JSON-выводом с помощью `jq`

Формат JSON упрощает программное извлечение конкретной информации. Вот типичные примеры:

#### Базовые операции с файлами
```bash
# Список всех путей файлов
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[]'

# Подсчёт общего количества файлов
cat repomix-output.json | jq '.files | keys | length'

# Извлечение содержимого конкретного файла
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files["README.md"]'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files["src/index.js"]'
```

#### Фильтрация и анализ файлов
```bash
# Поиск файлов по расширению
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(endswith(".ts"))'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(endswith(".js") or endswith(".ts"))'

# Получение файлов, содержащих определённый текст
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | select(.value | contains("function")) | .key'

# Создание списка файлов с количеством символов
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | "\(.key): \(.value | length) characters"'
```

#### Извлечение метаданных
```bash
# Извлечение структуры директорий
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.directoryStructure'

# Получение информации о сводке файлов
cat repomix-output.json | jq '.fileSummary.purpose'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.fileSummary.generationHeader'

# Извлечение пользовательского заголовка (если есть)
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.userProvidedHeader // "No header provided"'

# Получение пользовательских инструкций
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.instruction // "No instructions provided"'
```

#### Продвинутый анализ
```bash
# Поиск самых больших файлов по длине содержимого
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | [.key, (.value | length)] | @tsv' | sort -k2 -nr | head -10

# Поиск файлов, содержащих определённые паттерны
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | select(.value | test("import.*react"; "i")) | .key'

# Извлечение путей файлов, соответствующих нескольким расширениям
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(test("\.(js|ts|jsx|tsx)$"))'
```

## Формат простого текста

```bash
repomix --style plain
```

## Использование с ИИ-моделями

Каждый формат хорошо работает с ИИ-моделями, но учитывайте:
- Используйте XML для Claude (лучшая точность парсинга)
- Используйте Markdown для общей читаемости
- Используйте JSON для программной обработки и интеграции с API
- Используйте простой текст для простоты и универсальной совместимости

## Настройка

Установите формат по умолчанию в `repomix.config.json`:
```json
{
  "output": {
    "style": "xml",
    "filePath": "output.xml"
  }
}
```

`````markdown
# Безопасность

## Функция проверки безопасности

Repomix использует [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint) для обнаружения конфиденциальной информации в ваших файлах:
- API-ключи
- Токены доступа
- Учётные данные
- Приватные ключи
- Переменные окружения

## Конфигурация

Проверки безопасности включены по умолчанию.

Отключение через CLI:
```bash
repomix --no-security-check
```

Или в `repomix.config.json`:
```json
{
  "security": {
    "enableSecurityCheck": false
  }
}
```

## Меры безопасности

1. **Обработка бинарных файлов**: Содержимое бинарных файлов исключается из вывода, но их пути перечислены в структуре директорий для полного обзора репозитория
2. **Интеграция с Git**: Учитывает паттерны `.gitignore`
3. **Автоматическое обнаружение**: Сканирует на типичные проблемы безопасности:
  - Учётные данные AWS
  - Строки подключения к базе данных
  - Токены аутентификации
  - Приватные ключи

## Когда проверка безопасности находит проблемы

Пример вывода:
```bash
🔍 Security Check:
──────────────────
2 suspicious file(s) detected and excluded:
1. config/credentials.json
  - Found AWS access key
2. .env.local
  - Found database password
```

## Лучшие практики

1. Всегда проверяйте вывод перед публикацией
2. Используйте `.repomixignore` для конфиденциальных путей
3. Держите проверки безопасности включёнными
4. Удаляйте конфиденциальные файлы из репозитория

## Сообщение об уязвимостях безопасности

Нашли уязвимость безопасности? Пожалуйста:
1. Не открывайте публичный issue
2. Напишите на email: koukun0120@gmail.com
3. Или используйте [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/security/advisories/new)

repomix path/to/directory
```

### Включение конкретных файлов
Используйте [glob-паттерны](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax):
```bash
repomix --include "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md"
```

### Исключение файлов
```bash
repomix --ignore "**/*.log,tmp/"
```

### Удалённые репозитории
```bash
# Использование GitHub URL
repomix --remote https://github.com/user/repo

# Использование сокращения
repomix --remote user/repo

# Конкретная ветка/тег/коммит
repomix --remote user/repo --remote-branch main
repomix --remote user/repo --remote-branch 935b695
```

### Ввод списка файлов (stdin)

Передавайте пути файлов через stdin для максимальной гибкости:

```bash
# Использование команды find
find src -name "*.ts" -type f | repomix --stdin

# Использование git для получения отслеживаемых файлов
git ls-files "*.ts" | repomix --stdin

# Использование ripgrep (rg) для поиска файлов
rg --files --type ts | repomix --stdin

# Использование grep для поиска файлов с определённым содержимым
grep -l "TODO" **/*.ts | repomix --stdin

# Использование ripgrep для поиска файлов с определённым содержимым
rg -l "TODO|FIXME" --type ts | repomix --stdin

# Использование sharkdp/fd для поиска файлов
fd -e ts | repomix --stdin

# Использование fzf для выбора из всех файлов
fzf -m | repomix --stdin

# Интерактивный выбор файлов с fzf
find . -name "*.ts" -type f | fzf -m | repomix --stdin

# Использование ls с glob-паттернами
ls src/**/*.ts | repomix --stdin

# Из файла, содержащего пути файлов
cat file-list.txt | repomix --stdin

# Прямой ввод с echo
echo -e "src/index.ts\nsrc/utils.ts" | repomix --stdin
```

Опция `--stdin` позволяет передавать список путей файлов в Repomix, давая вам максимальную гибкость в выборе файлов для упаковки.

При использовании `--stdin` указанные файлы фактически добавляются к паттернам включения. Это означает, что обычное поведение include и ignore по-прежнему применяется — файлы, указанные через stdin, всё равно будут исключены, если они соответствуют паттернам игнорирования.

> [!NOTE]
> При использовании `--stdin` пути файлов могут быть относительными или абсолютными, и Repomix автоматически обработает разрешение путей и удаление дубликатов.

### Сжатие кода

```bash
repomix --compress

# Также можно использовать с удалёнными репозиториями:
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix --compress
```

### Интеграция с Git

Включите информацию Git для предоставления контекста разработки для анализа ИИ:

```bash
# Включить git diff (незакоммиченные изменения)
repomix --include-diffs

# Включить логи git-коммитов (по умолчанию последние 50)
repomix --include-logs

# Включить определённое количество коммитов
repomix --include-logs --include-logs-count 10

# Включить и diff, и логи
repomix --include-diffs --include-logs
```

Это добавляет ценный контекст о:
- **Последних изменениях**: Git diff показывает незакоммиченные модификации
- **Паттернах разработки**: Git-логи раскрывают, какие файлы обычно изменяются вместе
- **Истории коммитов**: Последние сообщения коммитов дают представление о фокусе разработки
- **Связях файлов**: Понимание того, какие файлы модифицируются в одних и тех же коммитах

### Оптимизация подсчёта токенов

Понимание распределения токенов в вашей кодовой базе критически важно для оптимизации взаимодействия с ИИ. Используйте опцию `--token-count-tree` для визуализации использования токенов в проекте:

```bash
repomix --token-count-tree
```

Это отображает иерархическое представление вашей кодовой базы с количеством токенов:

```
🔢 Token Count Tree:
────────────────────
└── src/ (70,925 tokens)
    ├── cli/ (12,714 tokens)
    │   ├── actions/ (7,546 tokens)
    │   └── reporters/ (990 tokens)
    └── core/ (41,600 tokens)
        ├── file/ (10,098 tokens)
        └── output/ (5,808 tokens)
```

Вы также можете установить минимальный порог токенов, чтобы сосредоточиться на больших файлах:

```bash
repomix --token-count-tree 1000  # Показывать только файлы/директории с 1000+ токенов
```

Это помогает вам:
- **Определить файлы с большим количеством токенов**, которые могут превысить лимиты контекста ИИ
- **Оптимизировать выбор файлов** с помощью паттернов `--include` и `--ignore`
- **Планировать стратегии сжатия**, нацеливаясь на самых крупных «потребителей»
- **Балансировать контент и контекст** при подготовке кода для анализа ИИ

## Форматы вывода

### XML (по умолчанию)
```bash
repomix --style xml
```

### Markdown
```bash
repomix --style markdown

## Почему Repomix?

Сила Repomix заключается в способности работать с любым сервисом подписки, таким как ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, не беспокоясь о расходах, при этом предоставляя полный контекст кодовой базы, что устраняет необходимость в исследовании файлов — делая анализ быстрее и зачастую точнее.

Имея всю кодовую базу в качестве контекста, Repomix позволяет выполнять широкий спектр задач, включая планирование реализации, исследование багов, проверки безопасности сторонних библиотек, генерацию документации и многое другое.

## Использование CLI-инструмента {#using-the-cli-tool}

Repomix можно использовать как инструмент командной строки с мощными функциями и опциями настройки.

**CLI-инструмент имеет доступ к приватным репозиториям**, так как использует ваш локально установленный git.

### Быстрый старт

Вы можете сразу попробовать Repomix в директории вашего проекта без установки:

```bash
npx repomix@latest
```

Или установите глобально для многократного использования:

```bash
# Установка с помощью npm
npm install -g repomix

# Альтернативно с помощью yarn
yarn global add repomix

# Альтернативно с помощью bun
bun add -g repomix

# Альтернативно с помощью Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
brew install repomix

# Затем запустите в любой директории проекта
repomix
```

Готово! Repomix создаст файл `repomix-output.xml` в текущей директории, содержащий весь ваш репозиторий в формате, удобном для ИИ.



### Использование

Для упаковки всего репозитория:

```bash
repomix
```

Для упаковки конкретной директории:

```bash
repomix path/to/directory
```

Для упаковки конкретных файлов или директорий с использованием [glob-паттернов](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax):

```bash
repomix --include "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md"
```

Для исключения конкретных файлов или директорий:

```bash
repomix --ignore "**/*.log,tmp/"
```

Для упаковки удалённого репозитория:
```bash
# Используя сокращённый формат
npx repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix

# Используя полный URL (поддерживает ветки и конкретные пути)
npx repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix
npx repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/tree/main

# Используя URL коммита
npx repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/commit/836...
```

Для создания нового файла конфигурации (`repomix.config.json`):

```bash
repomix --init
```

После создания упакованного файла вы можете использовать его с генеративными ИИ-инструментами, такими как Claude, ChatGPT и Gemini.

#### Использование Docker

Вы также можете запустить Repomix с помощью Docker 🐳
Это полезно, если вы хотите запустить Repomix в изолированной среде или предпочитаете контейнеры.

Базовое использование (текущая директория):

```bash
docker run -v .:/app -it --rm ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix
```

Для упаковки конкретной директории:
```bash
docker run -v .:/app -it --rm ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix path/to/directory
```

Обработка удалённого репозитория с выводом в директорию `output`:

```bash
docker run -v ./output:/app -it --rm ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix
```

### Форматы вывода

Выберите предпочтительный формат вывода:

```bash
# Формат XML (по умолчанию)
repomix --style xml

# Формат Markdown
repomix --style markdown

# Формат JSON
repomix --style json

# Простой текст
repomix --style plain
```

### Настройка

Создайте файл `repomix.config.json` для постоянных настроек:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "style": "markdown",
    "filePath": "custom-output.md",
    "removeComments": true,
    "showLineNumbers": true,
    "topFilesLength": 10
  },
  "ignore": {
    "customPatterns": ["*.test.ts", "docs/**"]
  }
}
```

# Sử dụng Repomix như một thư viện

Ngoài việc sử dụng Repomix như một công cụ dòng lệnh, bạn cũng có thể tích hợp nó trực tiếp vào các ứng dụng JavaScript hoặc TypeScript của mình như một thư viện.

## Cài đặt

Để sử dụng Repomix như một thư viện, trước tiên hãy cài đặt nó như một phụ thuộc:

```bash
# Sử dụng npm
npm install repomix

# Sử dụng yarn
yarn add repomix

# Sử dụng pnpm
pnpm add repomix
```

## Sử dụng cơ bản

Dưới đây là một ví dụ cơ bản về cách sử dụng Repomix trong mã của bạn:

```typescript
import { processRepository } from 'repomix';

async function packMyRepo() {
  try {
    const result = await processRepository({
      path: '/path/to/your/repository',
      output: {
        style: 'xml',
        filePath: 'output.xml',
      },
    });

    console.log('Repository packed successfully!');
    console.log(`Output saved to: ${result.outputPath}`);
    console.log(`Total files: ${result.stats.fileCount}`);
    console.log(`Total tokens: ${result.stats.totalTokens}`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error packing repository:', error);
  }
}

packMyRepo();
```

## API

### processRepository

Hàm chính để xử lý một kho lưu trữ:

```typescript
async function processRepository(options: RepositoryProcessorOptions): Promise<RepositoryProcessorResult>
```

#### Tùy chọn

Đối tượng `RepositoryProcessorOptions` chấp nhận các tùy chọn sau:

```typescript
interface RepositoryProcessorOptions {
  // Đường dẫn đến kho lưu trữ cục bộ
  path?: string;
  
  // URL của kho lưu trữ từ xa (thay thế cho path)
  remote?: string;
  
  // Cấu hình đầu ra
  output?: {
    // Định dạng đầu ra (xml, markdown, plain)
    style?: 'xml' | 'markdown' | 'plain';
    
    // Đường dẫn tệp đầu ra
    filePath?: string;
    
    // Xóa bình luận khỏi mã nguồn
    removeComments?: boolean;
    
    // Hiển thị số dòng trong đầu ra
    showLineNumbers?: boolean;
    
    // Số lượng tệp hàng đầu để hiển thị trong tóm tắt
    topFilesLength?: number;
    
    // Nội dung hướng dẫn tùy chỉnh
    instructions?: string;
    
    // Đường dẫn đến tệp hướng dẫn
    instructionsPath?: string;
  };
  
  // Cấu hình bỏ qua
  ignore?: {
    // Tôn trọng các tệp .gitignore
    respectGitignore?: boolean;
    
    // Mảng các mẫu glob để bỏ qua
    customPatterns?: string[];
  };
  
  // Cấu hình bảo mật
  security?: {
    // Bật kiểm tra bảo mật
    check?: boolean;
    
    // Đường dẫn đến tệp cấu hình Secretlint
    secretlintConfigPath?: string;
  };
  
  // Cấu hình nâng cao
  advanced?: {
    // Nén mã bằng cách chỉ bao gồm chữ ký hàm
    compressCode?: boolean;
    
    // Bật đếm token
    tokenCount?: boolean;
  };
  
  // Mẫu bao gồm (phân tách bằng dấu phẩy)
  include?: string;
}
```

#### Kết quả

Hàm `processRepository` trả về một Promise giải quyết thành một đối tượng `RepositoryProcessorResult`:

```typescript
interface RepositoryProcessorResult {
  // Đường dẫn đến tệp đầu ra
  outputPath: string;
  
  // Nội dung đầu ra
  output: string;
  
  // Thống kê về kho lưu trữ đã xử lý
  stats: {
    // Số lượng tệp đã xử lý
    fileCount: number;
    
    // Tổng số dòng
    totalLines: number;
    
    // Tổng số token
    totalTokens: number;
    
    // Thông tin về các tệp hàng đầu
    topFiles: Array<{
      path: string;
      lines: number;
      tokens: number;
    }>;
  };
}
```

## Ví dụ nâng cao

### Xử lý kho lưu trữ từ xa

```typescript
import { processRepository } from 'repomix';

async function packRemoteRepo() {
  const result = await processRepository({
    remote: 'https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix',
    output: {
      style: 'markdown',
      filePath: 'repomix-source.md',
    },
  });

  console.log(`Repository packed to: ${result.outputPath}`);
}

packRemoteRepo();
```

### Tùy chọn đầu ra tùy chỉnh

```typescript
import { processRepository } from 'repomix';

async function packWithCustomOptions() {
  const result = await processRepository({
    path: './my-project',
    output: {
      style: 'xml',
      filePath: 'output.xml',
      removeComments: true,
      showLineNumbers: true,
      topFilesLength: 20,
      instructions: 'Đây là codebase của dự án X. Vui lòng tập trung vào...',
    },
    ignore: {
      respectGitignore: true,
      customPatterns: ['*.test.ts', 'docs/**'],
    },
    advanced: {
      compressCode: true,
      tokenCount: true,
    },
  });

  console.log(`Packed ${result.stats.fileCount} files with ${result.stats.totalTokens} tokens`);
}

packWithCustomOptions();
```

### Xử lý đầu ra trong bộ nhớ

```typescript
import { processRepository } from 'repomix';
import * as fs from 'fs';

async function processAndModifyOutput() {
  // Xử lý kho lưu trữ
  const result = await processRepository({
    path: './my-project',
    output: {
      style: 'markdown',
      // Không chỉ định filePath để không ghi vào tệp
    },
  });

  // Sửa đổi đầu ra
  const modifiedOutput = `# Codebase được xử lý bởi ứng dụng tùy chỉnh\n\n${result.output}`;

  // Ghi đầu ra đã sửa đổi vào tệp
  fs.writeFileSync('custom-output.md', modifiedOutput);

  console.log('Custom processing complete!');
}

processAndModifyOutput();
```

### Tích hợp với Express

```typescript
import express from 'express';
import { processRepository } from 'repomix';

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/process', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { repoPath, options } = req.body;
    
    const result = await processRepository({
      path: repoPath,
      ...options,
    });
    
    res.json({
      success: true,
      stats: result.stats,
      output: result.output,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({
      success: false,
      error: error.message,
    });
  }
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Repomix API server running on port 3000');
});
```

## Xử lý lỗi

Khi sử dụng Repomix như một thư viện, hãy đảm bảo xử lý lỗi đúng cách:

```typescript
import { processRepository } from 'repomix';

async function safelyPackRepo() {
  try {
    const result = await processRepository({
      path: './my-project',
    });
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.code === 'SECURITY_ISSUE') {
      console.error('Security issue detected:', error.message);
      // Xử lý vấn đề bảo mật
    } else if (error.code === 'INVALID_PATH') {
      console.error('Invalid repository path:', error.message);
      // Xử lý đường dẫn không hợp lệ
    } else {
      console.error('Unexpected error:', error);
      // Xử lý lỗi khác
    }
    throw error; // Hoặc xử lý lỗi và trả về giá trị mặc định
  }
}
```

# Tạo Agent Skills

Repomix có thể tạo đầu ra theo định dạng [Claude Agent Skills](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills), tạo một thư mục Skills có cấu trúc có thể được sử dụng làm tham chiếu codebase có thể tái sử dụng cho các trợ lý AI.

Tính năng này đặc biệt mạnh mẽ khi bạn muốn tham chiếu các triển khai từ các repository từ xa. Bằng cách tạo Skills từ các dự án mã nguồn mở, bạn có thể dễ dàng yêu cầu Claude tham chiếu các mẫu hoặc triển khai cụ thể trong khi làm việc trên code của riêng bạn.

Thay vì tạo một file đóng gói duy nhất, việc tạo Skills sẽ tạo một thư mục có cấu trúc với nhiều file tham chiếu được tối ưu hóa cho sự hiểu biết của AI và tìm kiếm tương thích grep.

> [!NOTE]
> Đây là một tính năng thử nghiệm. Định dạng đầu ra và các tùy chọn có thể thay đổi trong các bản phát hành tương lai dựa trên phản hồi của người dùng.

## Sử Dụng Cơ Bản

Tạo Skills từ thư mục cục bộ của bạn:

```bash
# Tạo Skills từ thư mục hiện tại
repomix --skill-generate

# Tạo với tên Skills tùy chỉnh
repomix --skill-generate my-project-reference

# Tạo từ thư mục cụ thể
repomix path/to/directory --skill-generate

# Tạo từ repository từ xa
repomix --remote https://github.com/user/repo --skill-generate
```

## Chọn Vị Trí Lưu Skills

Khi bạn chạy lệnh, Repomix sẽ yêu cầu bạn chọn nơi lưu Skills:

1. **Personal Skills** (`~/.claude/skills/`) - Có sẵn trên tất cả các dự án trên máy của bạn
2. **Project Skills** (`.claude/skills/`) - Chia sẻ với nhóm của bạn qua git

Nếu thư mục Skills đã tồn tại, bạn sẽ được yêu cầu xác nhận ghi đè.

> [!TIP]
> Khi tạo Project Skills, hãy cân nhắc thêm chúng vào `.gitignore` để tránh commit các file lớn:
> ```gitignore
> .claude/skills/repomix-reference-*/
> ```

## Cấu Trúc Được Tạo

Skills được tạo với cấu trúc sau:

```text
.claude/skills/<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md                    # Metadata chính và tài liệu Skills
└── references/
    ├── summary.md              # Mục đích, định dạng và thống kê
    ├── project-structure.md    # Cây thư mục với số dòng
    ├── files.md                # Tất cả nội dung file (tương thích grep)
    └── tech-stack.md           # Ngôn ngữ, framework, dependencies
```

### Mô Tả File

#### SKILL.md

File Skills chính chứa:
- Tên Skills, mô tả và thông tin dự án
- Số lượng file, số dòng và số token
- Tổng quan về cách sử dụng Skills
- Vị trí file và giải thích định dạng
- Các trường hợp sử dụng phổ biến và mẹo

#### references/summary.md

Chứa:
- **Mục đích**: Giải thích đây là codebase tham chiếu cho AI sử dụng
- **Cấu trúc File**: Tài liệu nội dung của mỗi file tham chiếu
- **Hướng dẫn Sử dụng**: Cách sử dụng Skills hiệu quả
- **Thống kê**: Phân tích theo loại file, ngôn ngữ và file lớn nhất

#### references/project-structure.md

Cây thư mục với số dòng mỗi file để dễ dàng khám phá:

```text
src/
  index.ts (42 lines)
  utils/
    helpers.ts (128 lines)
    math.ts (87 lines)
```

#### references/files.md

Tất cả nội dung file với header syntax highlighting, được tối ưu hóa cho tìm kiếm tương thích grep:

````markdown
## File: src/index.ts
```typescript
import { sum } from './utils/helpers';

export function main() {
  console.log(sum(1, 2));
}
```
````

#### references/tech-stack.md

Tech stack được tự động phát hiện từ các file dependency:
- **Ngôn ngữ**: TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, v.v.
- **Framework**: React, Next.js, Express, Django, v.v.
- **Phiên bản Runtime**: Node.js, Python, Go, v.v.
- **Package Manager**: npm, pnpm, poetry, v.v.
- **Dependencies**: Tất cả dependency trực tiếp và dev
- **File Cấu hình**: Tất cả file cấu hình được phát hiện

Được phát hiện từ các file như: `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `.nvmrc`, `pyproject.toml`, v.v.

## Tên Skills Tự Động Tạo

Nếu không cung cấp tên, Repomix tự động tạo một tên theo mẫu này:

```bash
repomix src/ --skill-generate                # → repomix-reference-src
repomix --remote user/repo --skill-generate  # → repomix-reference-repo
repomix --skill-generate CustomName          # → custom-name (chuẩn hóa thành kebab-case)
```

Tên Skills sẽ:
- Được chuyển đổi thành kebab-case (chữ thường, phân cách bằng dấu gạch ngang)
- Giới hạn tối đa 64 ký tự
- Được bảo vệ chống path traversal

## Tích Hợp với Các Tùy Chọn Repomix

Việc tạo Skills tuân thủ tất cả các tùy chọn tiêu chuẩn của Repomix:

```bash
# Tạo Skills với lọc file
repomix --skill-generate --include "src/**/*.ts" --ignore "**/*.test.ts"

# Tạo Skills với nén
repomix --skill-generate --compress

# Tạo Skills từ repository từ xa
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix --skill-generate

# Tạo Skills với các tùy chọn định dạng đầu ra cụ thể
repomix --skill-generate --remove-comments --remove-empty-lines
```

### Skills Chỉ Tài Liệu

Sử dụng `--include`, bạn có thể tạo Skills chỉ chứa tài liệu từ một repository GitHub. Điều này hữu ích khi bạn muốn Claude tham chiếu tài liệu thư viện hoặc framework cụ thể trong khi làm việc trên code của bạn:

```bash
# Tài liệu Claude Code Action
repomix --remote https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action --include docs --skill-generate

# Tài liệu Vite
repomix --remote https://github.com/vitejs/vite --include docs --skill-generate

# Tài liệu React
repomix --remote https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev --include src/content --skill-generate
```

## Hạn Chế

Tùy chọn `--skill-generate` không thể sử dụng với:
- `--stdout` - Đầu ra Skills yêu cầu ghi vào hệ thống file
- `--copy` - Đầu ra Skills là thư mục, không thể sao chép vào clipboard

## Sử Dụng Skills Đã Tạo

Sau khi tạo, bạn có thể sử dụng Skills với Claude:

1. **Claude Code**: Skills tự động khả dụng nếu được lưu vào `~/.claude/skills/` hoặc `.claude/skills/`
2. **Claude Web**: Tải thư mục Skills lên Claude để phân tích codebase
3. **Chia sẻ Nhóm**: Commit `.claude/skills/` vào repository của bạn để cả nhóm truy cập

## Quy Trình Làm Việc Mẫu

### Tạo Thư Viện Tham Chiếu Cá Nhân

```bash
# Clone và phân tích một dự án mã nguồn mở thú vị
repomix --remote facebook/react --skill-generate react-reference

# Skills được lưu vào ~/.claude/skills/react-reference/
# Bây giờ bạn có thể tham chiếu codebase của React trong bất kỳ cuộc hội thoại Claude nào
```

### Tài Liệu Dự Án Nhóm

```bash
# Trong thư mục dự án của bạn
cd my-project

# Tạo Skills cho nhóm của bạn
repomix --skill-generate

# Chọn "Project Skills" khi được yêu cầu
# Skills được lưu vào .claude/skills/repomix-reference-my-project/

# Commit và chia sẻ với nhóm của bạn
git add .claude/skills/
git commit -m "Add codebase reference Skills"
```

# Nén mã

Repomix cung cấp tính năng nén mã để giảm kích thước đầu ra bằng cách chỉ bao gồm chữ ký hàm và loại bỏ phần thân hàm. Điều này đặc biệt hữu ích khi làm việc với các codebase lớn và giới hạn token của mô hình ngôn ngữ lớn (LLM).

## Tổng quan

Tính năng nén mã:

- Giữ lại chữ ký hàm, lớp và phương thức
- Loại bỏ phần thân hàm và phương thức
- Duy trì cấu trúc tổng thể của codebase
- Giảm đáng kể số lượng token

Điều này cho phép AI hiểu cấu trúc và API của codebase mà không cần xem xét từng dòng mã triển khai.

## Sử dụng tính năng nén mã

### Thông qua dòng lệnh

Để bật nén mã khi chạy Repomix:

```bash
repomix --compress-code
```

### Thông qua tệp cấu hình

Bạn cũng có thể bật nén mã trong tệp cấu hình `repomix.config.json`:

```json
{
  "advanced": {
    "compressCode": true
  }
}
```

## Ví dụ nén mã

### Mã gốc

```typescript
/**
 * Lớp User đại diện cho người dùng trong hệ thống
 */
class User {
  private name: string;
  private email: string;
  private age: number;

  /**
   * Tạo một người dùng mới
   */
  constructor(name: string, email: string, age: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.email = email;
    this.age = age;
    console.log(`Người dùng mới được tạo: ${name}`);
  }

  /**
   * Trả về tên người dùng
   */
  getName(): string {
    return this.name;
  }

  /**
   * Trả về email người dùng
   */
  getEmail(): string {
    return this.email;
  }

  /**
   * Trả về tuổi người dùng
   */
  getAge(): number {
    return this.age;
  }

  /**
   * Kiểm tra xem người dùng có phải là người trưởng thành không
   */
  isAdult(): boolean {
    return this.age >= 18;
  }

  /**
   * Cập nhật thông tin người dùng
   */
  updateInfo(name?: string, email?: string, age?: number): void {
    if (name) this.name = name;
    if (email) this.email = email;
    if (age) this.age = age;
    console.log('Thông tin người dùng đã được cập nhật');
  }
}
```

### Mã đã nén

```typescript
/**
 * Lớp User đại diện cho người dùng trong hệ thống
 */
class User {
  private name: string;
  private email: string;
  private age: number;

  /**
   * Tạo một người dùng mới
   */
  constructor(name: string, email: string, age: number) { /* ... */ }

  /**
   * Trả về tên người dùng
   */
  getName(): string { /* ... */ }

  /**
   * Trả về email người dùng
   */
  getEmail(): string { /* ... */ }

  /**
   * Trả về tuổi người dùng
   */
  getAge(): number { /* ... */ }

  /**
   * Kiểm tra xem người dùng có phải là người trưởng thành không
   */
  isAdult(): boolean { /* ... */ }

  /**
   * Cập nhật thông tin người dùng
   */
  updateInfo(name?: string, email?: string, age?: number): void { /* ... */ }
}
```

## Lợi ích của nén mã

### Giảm số lượng token

Nén mã có thể giảm đáng kể số lượng token cần thiết để đại diện cho codebase, cho phép bạn đưa vào nhiều tệp hơn trong cùng một giới hạn token.

### Tập trung vào cấu trúc

Bằng cách chỉ hiển thị chữ ký hàm, AI có thể tập trung vào cấu trúc tổng thể và API của codebase thay vì chi tiết triển khai.

### Phân tích cấp cao

Nén mã rất hữu ích cho các nhiệm vụ phân tích cấp cao như:
- Hiểu cấu trúc dự án
- Xác định mẫu thiết kế
- Phân tích phụ thuộc
- Tạo tài liệu

## Khi nào nên sử dụng nén mã

Nén mã đặc biệt hữu ích trong các trường hợp sau:

- **Codebase lớn**: Khi codebase của bạn quá lớn để phù hợp với giới hạn token của LLM
- **Phân tích cấu trúc**: Khi bạn muốn AI tập trung vào cấu trúc tổng thể thay vì chi tiết triển khai
- **Tạo tài liệu**: Khi bạn muốn tạo tài liệu dựa trên API công khai
- **Hiểu tổng quan**: Khi bạn cần hiểu tổng quan về một codebase lớn

## Khi nào không nên sử dụng nén mã

Nén mã có thể không phù hợp trong các trường hợp sau:

- **Phân tích mã chi tiết**: Khi bạn cần AI phân tích chi tiết triển khai
- **Tìm lỗi**: Khi bạn đang tìm kiếm lỗi trong mã
- **Tối ưu hóa hiệu suất**: Khi bạn muốn AI đề xuất cải tiến hiệu suất
- **Tái cấu trúc mã**: Khi bạn cần AI hiểu đầy đủ logic hiện tại để đề xuất tái cấu trúc

## Kết hợp với các tính năng khác

Nén mã có thể được kết hợp với các tính năng khác của Repomix:

```bash
repomix --compress-code --remove-comments --style markdown
```

Lệnh này sẽ tạo một đầu ra Markdown với mã đã nén và không có bình luận, giảm đáng kể kích thước đầu ra.

# Xóa bình luận

Repomix cung cấp tùy chọn để xóa bình luận khỏi mã nguồn trong đầu ra, giúp giảm kích thước đầu ra và tập trung vào mã thực tế.

## Tổng quan

Bình luận trong mã nguồn rất hữu ích cho các nhà phát triển, nhưng chúng có thể:

- Chiếm không gian token quý giá khi làm việc với các mô hình ngôn ngữ lớn (LLMs)
- Chứa thông tin không liên quan hoặc lỗi thời
- Làm phân tâm khỏi cấu trúc mã thực tế

Tính năng xóa bình luận của Repomix giúp giải quyết những vấn đề này bằng cách loại bỏ bình luận khỏi đầu ra.

## Sử dụng tính năng xóa bình luận

### Thông qua dòng lệnh

Để bật xóa bình luận khi chạy Repomix:

```bash
repomix --remove-comments
```

Lệnh này sẽ xóa tất cả các bình luận khỏi mã nguồn trong đầu ra.

### Thông qua tệp cấu hình

Bạn cũng có thể bật xóa bình luận trong tệp cấu hình `repomix.config.json`:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "removeComments": true
  }
}
```

## Các loại bình luận được xóa

Repomix xóa các loại bình luận sau:

### Bình luận dòng đơn

```javascript
// Đây là một bình luận dòng đơn
const x = 5;
```

### Bình luận nhiều dòng

```javascript
/*
 * Đây là một bình luận
 * nhiều dòng
 */
const y = 10;
```

### Bình luận tài liệu

```javascript
/**
 * Hàm này tính tổng hai số
 * @param {number} a - Số thứ nhất
 * @param {number} b - Số thứ hai
 * @returns {number} Tổng của a và b
 */
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

### Bình luận JSX/TSX

```jsx
const element = (
  <div>
    {/* Đây là một bình luận JSX */}
    <p>Hello, world!</p>
  </div>
);
```

### Bình luận HTML

```html
<!-- Đây là một bình luận HTML -->
<div>Hello, world!</div>
```

## Hỗ trợ ngôn ngữ

Tính năng xóa bình luận hỗ trợ nhiều ngôn ngữ lập trình, bao gồm nhưng không giới hạn ở:

- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Python
- Java
- C/C++
- C#
- Go
- Ruby
- PHP
- HTML/CSS
- Rust
- Swift
- Kotlin

## Khi nào nên sử dụng xóa bình luận

Xóa bình luận đặc biệt hữu ích trong các trường hợp sau:

- **Giới hạn token**: Khi bạn cần giảm số lượng token để phù hợp với giới hạn ngữ cảnh của LLM
- **Tập trung vào mã**: Khi bạn muốn AI tập trung vào mã thực tế thay vì bình luận
- **Bình luận lỗi thời**: Khi codebase có bình luận lỗi thời có thể gây nhầm lẫn cho AI
- **Phân tích mã**: Khi bạn muốn AI phân tích cấu trúc mã mà không bị ảnh hưởng bởi bình luận

## Khi nào nên giữ lại bình luận

Trong một số trường hợp, bạn có thể muốn giữ lại bình luận:

- **Tài liệu API**: Khi bình luận chứa thông tin API quan trọng
- **Giải thích thuật toán phức tạp**: Khi bình luận giải thích các thuật toán hoặc logic phức tạp
- **Bối cảnh dự án**: Khi bình luận cung cấp bối cảnh quan trọng về dự án
- **Hướng dẫn sử dụng**: Khi bình luận chứa hướng dẫn sử dụng quan trọng

## Ví dụ so sánh

### Với bình luận

```javascript
/**
 * Lớp User đại diện cho người dùng trong hệ thống
 */
class User {
  /**
   * Tạo một người dùng mới
   * @param {string} name - Tên người dùng
   * @param {string} email - Email người dùng
   */
  constructor(name, email) {
    // Lưu trữ tên người dùng
    this.name = name;
    // Lưu trữ email người dùng
    this.email = email;
  }

  /**
   * Trả về thông tin người dùng dưới dạng chuỗi
   * @returns {string} Thông tin người dùng
   */
  getInfo() {
    // Trả về thông tin người dùng
    return `${this.name} (${this.email})`;
  }
}
```

### Không có bình luận

```javascript
class User {
  constructor(name, email) {
    this.name = name;
    this.email = email;
  }

  getInfo() {
    return `${this.name} (${this.email})`;
  }
}
```

# Cấu hình

Repomix có thể được cấu hình bằng file cấu hình hoặc các tùy chọn dòng lệnh. File cấu hình cho phép bạn tùy chỉnh các khía cạnh khác nhau về cách xử lý và xuất ra codebase của bạn.

## Các định dạng file cấu hình

Repomix hỗ trợ nhiều định dạng file cấu hình để mang lại sự linh hoạt và dễ sử dụng.

Repomix sẽ tự động tìm kiếm các file cấu hình theo thứ tự ưu tiên sau:

1. **TypeScript** (`repomix.config.ts`, `repomix.config.mts`, `repomix.config.cts`)
2. **JavaScript/ES Module** (`repomix.config.js`, `repomix.config.mjs`, `repomix.config.cjs`)
3. **JSON** (`repomix.config.json5`, `repomix.config.jsonc`, `repomix.config.json`)

### Cấu hình JSON

Tạo file cấu hình trong thư mục dự án của bạn:
```bash
repomix --init
```

Điều này sẽ tạo file `repomix.config.json` với các cài đặt mặc định. Bạn cũng có thể tạo file cấu hình toàn cục sẽ được sử dụng làm phương án dự phòng khi không tìm thấy cấu hình cục bộ:

```bash
repomix --init --global
```

### Cấu hình TypeScript

File cấu hình TypeScript cung cấp trải nghiệm developer tốt nhất với kiểm tra kiểu đầy đủ và hỗ trợ IDE.

**Cài đặt:**

Để sử dụng cấu hình TypeScript hoặc JavaScript với `defineConfig`, bạn cần cài đặt Repomix như một dev dependency:

```bash
npm install -D repomix
```

**Ví dụ:**

```typescript
// repomix.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'repomix';

export default defineConfig({
  output: {
    filePath: 'output.xml',
    style: 'xml',
    removeComments: true,
  },
  ignore: {
    customPatterns: ['**/node_modules/**', '**/dist/**'],
  },
});
```

**Lợi ích:**
- ✅ Kiểm tra kiểu TypeScript đầy đủ trong IDE của bạn
- ✅ Autocomplete và IntelliSense tuyệt vời trong IDE
- ✅ Sử dụng các giá trị động (timestamps, biến môi trường, v.v.)

**Ví dụ về giá trị động:**

```typescript
// repomix.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'repomix';

// Tạo tên file dựa trên timestamp
const timestamp = new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 19).replace(/[:.]/g, '-');

export default defineConfig({
  output: {
    filePath: `output-${timestamp}.xml`,
    style: 'xml',
  },
});
```

### Cấu hình JavaScript

File cấu hình JavaScript hoạt động tương tự như TypeScript, hỗ trợ `defineConfig` và các giá trị động.

## Các tùy chọn cấu hình

File cấu hình hỗ trợ cú pháp [JSON5](https://json5.org/), cho phép:
- Bình luận (cả single-line và multi-line)
- Dấu phẩy ở cuối trong objects và arrays
- Tên thuộc tính không có dấu ngoặc kép
- Cú pháp chuỗi linh hoạt hơn

## Xác thực Schema

Bạn có thể bật xác thực schema cho file cấu hình của mình bằng cách thêm thuộc tính `$schema`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://repomix.com/schemas/latest/schema.json",
  "output": {
    "filePath": "repomix-output.md",
    "style": "markdown"
  }
}
```

Điều này cung cấp auto-completion và validation trong các editor hỗ trợ JSON schema.

## Ví dụ File Cấu hình

Đây là ví dụ về file cấu hình hoàn chỉnh (`repomix.config.json`):

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://repomix.com/schemas/latest/schema.json",
  "input": {
    "maxFileSize": 50000000
  },
  "output": {
    "filePath": "repomix-output.xml",
    "style": "xml",
    "parsableStyle": false,
    "compress": false,
    "headerText": "Thông tin header tùy chỉnh cho file đã đóng gói.",
    "fileSummary": true,
    "directoryStructure": true,
    "files": true,
    "removeComments": false,
    "removeEmptyLines": false,
    "topFilesLength": 5,
    "showLineNumbers": false,
    "truncateBase64": false,
    "copyToClipboard": false,
    "includeEmptyDirectories": false,
    "git": {
      "sortByChanges": true,
      "sortByChangesMaxCommits": 100,
      "includeDiffs": false,
      "includeLogs": false,
      "includeLogsCount": 50
    }
  },
  "include": ["**/*"],
  "ignore": {
    "useGitignore": true,
    "useDefaultPatterns": true,
    // Các mẫu cũng có thể được chỉ định trong .repomixignore
    "customPatterns": [
      "additional-folder",
      "**/*.log"
    ],
  },
  "security": {
    "enableSecurityCheck": true
  },
  "tokenCount": {
    "encoding": "o200k_base"
  }
}
```

## Vị trí File Cấu hình

Repomix tìm kiếm file cấu hình theo thứ tự sau:
1. File cấu hình cục bộ trong thư mục hiện tại (thứ tự ưu tiên: TS > JS > JSON)
   - TypeScript: `repomix.config.ts`, `repomix.config.mts`, `repomix.config.cts`
   - JavaScript: `repomix.config.js`, `repomix.config.mjs`, `repomix.config.cjs`
   - JSON: `repomix.config.json5`, `repomix.config.jsonc`, `repomix.config.json`
2. File cấu hình toàn cục (thứ tự ưu tiên: TS > JS > JSON)
   - Windows:
     - TypeScript: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.ts`, `.mts`, `.cts`
     - JavaScript: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`
     - JSON: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.json5`, `.jsonc`, `.json`
   - macOS/Linux:
     - TypeScript: `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.ts`, `.mts`, `.cts`
     - JavaScript: `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`
     - JSON: `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.json5`, `.jsonc`, `.json`

Các tùy chọn dòng lệnh có ưu tiên cao hơn cài đặt file cấu hình.

## Mẫu Ignore

Repomix cung cấp nhiều cách để chỉ định file nào nên được ignore:

- **.gitignore**: Theo mặc định, các mẫu được liệt kê trong file `.gitignore` và `.git/info/exclude` của dự án được sử dụng. Hành vi này có thể được kiểm soát bằng cài đặt `ignore.useGitignore` hoặc tùy chọn CLI `--no-gitignore`.
- **.ignore**: Bạn có thể sử dụng file `.ignore` trong thư mục gốc dự án, theo cùng định dạng với `.gitignore`. File này được các công cụ như ripgrep và the silver searcher sử dụng, giảm nhu cầu duy trì nhiều file ignore. Hành vi này có thể được kiểm soát bằng cài đặt `ignore.useDotIgnore` hoặc tùy chọn CLI `--no-dot-ignore`.
- **Mẫu mặc định**: Repomix bao gồm danh sách mặc định các file và thư mục thường được loại trừ (ví dụ: node_modules, .git, file nhị phân). Tính năng này có thể được kiểm soát bằng cài đặt `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` hoặc tùy chọn CLI `--no-default-patterns`. Vui lòng xem [defaultIgnore.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/src/config/defaultIgnore.ts) để biết thêm chi tiết.
- **.repomixignore**: Bạn có thể tạo file `.repomixignore` trong thư mục gốc dự án để định nghĩa các mẫu ignore cụ thể cho Repomix. File này tuân theo cùng định dạng với `.gitignore`.
- **Mẫu tùy chỉnh**: Các mẫu ignore bổ sung có thể được chỉ định bằng tùy chọn `ignore.customPatterns` trong file cấu hình. Bạn có thể ghi đè cài đặt này bằng tùy chọn dòng lệnh `-i, --ignore`.

**Thứ tự ưu tiên** (từ cao đến thấp):

1. Mẫu tùy chỉnh (`ignore.customPatterns`)
2. File ignore (`.repomixignore`, `.ignore`, `.gitignore`, và `.git/info/exclude`):
   - Khi trong các thư mục lồng nhau, file ở thư mục sâu hơn có ưu tiên cao hơn
   - Khi trong cùng thư mục, các file này được hợp nhất không theo thứ tự cụ thể
3. Mẫu mặc định (nếu `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` là true và không sử dụng `--no-default-patterns`)

Ví dụ về `.repomixignore`:
```text
# Thư mục cache
.cache/
tmp/

# Đầu ra build
dist/
build/

# Logs
*.log
```

## Mẫu Ignore Mặc định

Khi `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` là true, Repomix tự động ignore các mẫu phổ biến:
```text
node_modules/**
.git/**
coverage/**
dist/**
```

Để xem danh sách đầy đủ, hãy xem [defaultIgnore.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/src/config/defaultIgnore.ts)

## Tính năng Nâng cao

### Nén Mã

Tính năng nén mã, được bật với `output.compress: true`, sử dụng [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) để trích xuất thông minh các cấu trúc mã cần thiết trong khi loại bỏ các chi tiết triển khai. Điều này giúp giảm số lượng token trong khi duy trì thông tin cấu trúc quan trọng.

Lợi ích chính:
- Giảm đáng kể số lượng token
- Bảo toàn signature của class và function
- Duy trì import và export
- Giữ lại định nghĩa type và interface
- Loại bỏ function body và chi tiết triển khai

Để biết thêm chi tiết và ví dụ, hãy xem [Hướng dẫn Nén Mã](code-compress).

### Tích hợp Git

Cấu hình `output.git` cung cấp các tính năng Git-aware mạnh mẽ:

- `sortByChanges`: Khi là true, các file được sắp xếp theo số lượng thay đổi Git (các commit đã sửa đổi file). Các file có nhiều thay đổi hơn xuất hiện ở cuối đầu ra. Điều này giúp ưu tiên các file được phát triển tích cực hơn. Mặc định: `true`
- `sortByChangesMaxCommits`: Số lượng commit tối đa để phân tích khi đếm các thay đổi file. Mặc định: `100`
- `includeDiffs`: Khi là true, bao gồm các sự khác biệt Git trong đầu ra (bao gồm riêng biệt các thay đổi work tree và staged). Điều này cho phép người đọc xem các thay đổi đang chờ trong repository. Mặc định: `false`
- `includeLogs`: Khi là true, bao gồm nhật ký Git trong đầu ra. Hiển thị lịch sử commit với ngày tháng, thông điệp và đường dẫn tệp. Điều này giúp AI hiểu các mẫu phát triển và mối quan hệ tệp. Mặc định: `false`
- `includeLogsCount`: Số lượng commit gần đây để bao gồm trong nhật ký git. Mặc định: `50`

Ví dụ cấu hình:
```json
{
  "output": {
    "git": {
      "sortByChanges": true,
      "sortByChangesMaxCommits": 100,
      "includeDiffs": true,
      "includeLogs": true,
      "includeLogsCount": 25
    }
  }
}
```

### Kiểm tra Bảo mật

Khi `security.enableSecurityCheck` được bật, Repomix sử dụng [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint) để phát hiện thông tin nhạy cảm trong codebase của bạn trước khi đưa vào đầu ra. Điều này giúp ngăn chặn việc tiết lộ vô tình:

- API keys
- Access tokens
- Private keys
- Passwords
- Các thông tin đăng nhập nhạy cảm khác

### Xóa Bình luận

Khi `output.removeComments` được đặt thành `true`, các bình luận sẽ được xóa khỏi các loại file được hỗ trợ để giảm kích thước đầu ra và tập trung vào nội dung mã cốt lõi. Điều này có thể đặc biệt hữu ích khi:

- Làm việc với mã được ghi chú nhiều
- Cố gắng giảm số lượng token
- Tập trung vào cấu trúc và logic mã

Để biết các ngôn ngữ được hỗ trợ và ví dụ chi tiết, hãy xem [Hướng dẫn Xóa Bình luận](comment-removal).

# Hướng dẫn tùy chỉnh

Repomix cho phép bạn thêm hướng dẫn tùy chỉnh vào đầu ra của mình, giúp hướng dẫn AI về cách hiểu và làm việc với codebase của bạn.

## Tổng quan

Hướng dẫn tùy chỉnh là một cách mạnh mẽ để:

1. Cung cấp ngữ cảnh về dự án của bạn
2. Giải thích các quy ước mã
3. Hướng dẫn AI về các phần quan trọng của codebase
4. Chỉ định các nhiệm vụ cụ thể bạn muốn AI thực hiện

## Thêm hướng dẫn tùy chỉnh

Có hai cách chính để thêm hướng dẫn tùy chỉnh vào đầu ra Repomix:

### 1. Sử dụng tệp hướng dẫn

Cách được khuyến nghị là tạo một tệp hướng dẫn riêng biệt và tham chiếu đến nó khi chạy Repomix:

```bash
repomix --instructions path/to/instructions.md
```

Tệp hướng dẫn có thể ở bất kỳ định dạng nào (Markdown được khuyến nghị cho khả năng đọc), và nội dung của nó sẽ được thêm vào đầu ra.

### 2. Sử dụng tệp cấu hình

Bạn cũng có thể chỉ định hướng dẫn trong tệp cấu hình Repomix:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "style": "xml",
    "filePath": "repomix-output.xml"
  },
  "instructions": {
    "content": "Đây là codebase của dự án X. Vui lòng tập trung vào...",
    "filePath": "path/to/instructions.md"
  }
}
```

Nếu cả `content` và `filePath` đều được chỉ định, `filePath` sẽ được ưu tiên.

## Hướng dẫn tùy chỉnh trong thư mục

Repomix cũng hỗ trợ hướng dẫn tùy chỉnh dựa trên thư mục. Bạn có thể tạo các tệp hướng dẫn trong thư mục `.github/instructions/` của kho lưu trữ của bạn:

- `.github/instructions/base.instructions.md`: Hướng dẫn cơ bản áp dụng cho toàn bộ kho lưu trữ
- `.github/instructions/path/to/dir.instructions.md`: Hướng dẫn cụ thể cho thư mục

Mỗi tệp hướng dẫn có thể bắt đầu bằng front matter YAML để chỉ định phạm vi áp dụng:

```markdown
---
applyTo: '**/*.ts'
---

# Hướng dẫn TypeScript

Các tệp TypeScript trong dự án này tuân theo...
```

Thuộc tính `applyTo` chấp nhận các mẫu glob để chỉ định các tệp mà hướng dẫn áp dụng.

## Ví dụ hướng dẫn tùy chỉnh

Dưới đây là một ví dụ về tệp hướng dẫn tùy chỉnh hiệu quả:

```markdown
# Hướng dẫn dự án Repomix

## Tổng quan dự án
Repomix là một công cụ đóng gói kho lưu trữ mã nguồn thành các định dạng thân thiện với AI. Nó được thiết kế để giúp bạn chia sẻ codebase của mình với các mô hình ngôn ngữ lớn.

## Cấu trúc dự án
- `src/`: Mã nguồn chính
  - `core/`: Chức năng cốt lõi để xử lý kho lưu trữ
  - `formatters/`: Các trình định dạng đầu ra (XML, Markdown, Plain)
  - `utils/`: Tiện ích và trợ giúp

## Quy ước mã
- Chúng tôi sử dụng TypeScript với kiểu nghiêm ngặt
- Chúng tôi tuân theo quy ước đặt tên camelCase cho biến và PascalCase cho lớp
- Các hàm nên có một trách nhiệm duy nhất

## Nhiệm vụ
Vui lòng phân tích codebase và đề xuất cách cải thiện:
1. Xác định các vấn đề hiệu suất tiềm ẩn
2. Đề xuất cải tiến cho khả năng bảo trì
3. Đánh giá khả năng mở rộng của kiến trúc hiện tại

## Lưu ý quan trọng
- Tệp `src/core/processor.ts` chứa logic xử lý chính
- Chúng tôi đang xem xét thêm hỗ trợ cho các định dạng đầu ra mới
```

## Thực hành tốt nhất

Khi tạo hướng dẫn tùy chỉnh:

1. **Bắt đầu với tổng quan**: Cung cấp ngữ cảnh ngắn gọn về dự án
2. **Giải thích cấu trúc**: Phác thảo cấu trúc thư mục và mục đích của chúng
3. **Làm rõ quy ước**: Đề cập đến bất kỳ quy ước mã hoặc mẫu thiết kế nào
4. **Chỉ định nhiệm vụ**: Nêu rõ những gì bạn muốn AI làm
5. **Đánh dấu các khu vực quan trọng**: Hướng dẫn sự chú ý đến các tệp hoặc mô-đun quan trọng
6. **Giữ ngắn gọn**: Tập trung vào thông tin có giá trị nhất

# GitHub Actions

Repomix có thể được tích hợp vào quy trình CI/CD của bạn bằng cách sử dụng GitHub Actions, cho phép bạn tự động đóng gói kho lưu trữ của mình và cung cấp đầu ra cho các bước tiếp theo.

## Tổng quan

Tích hợp Repomix với GitHub Actions cho phép bạn:

- Tự động đóng gói kho lưu trữ của bạn khi có thay đổi
- Lưu trữ đầu ra đã đóng gói dưới dạng artifact
- Sử dụng đầu ra đã đóng gói trong các bước quy trình công việc tiếp theo
- Tích hợp với các công cụ AI trong quy trình CI/CD của bạn

# Máy chủ MCP

Repomix hỗ trợ [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), cho phép các trợ lý AI tương tác trực tiếp với codebase của bạn. Khi chạy như một máy chủ MCP, Repomix cung cấp các công cụ cho phép các trợ lý AI đóng gói repository cục bộ hoặc từ xa để phân tích mà không cần chuẩn bị file thủ công.

> [!NOTE]  
> Đây là một tính năng thử nghiệm mà chúng tôi sẽ tích cực cải thiện dựa trên phản hồi của người dùng và việc sử dụng thực tế

## Chạy Repomix như một Máy chủ MCP

Để chạy Repomix như một máy chủ MCP, sử dụng flag `--mcp`:

```bash
repomix --mcp
```

Điều này khởi động Repomix ở chế độ máy chủ MCP, làm cho nó có sẵn cho các trợ lý AI hỗ trợ Model Context Protocol.

## Cấu hình Máy chủ MCP

Để sử dụng Repomix như một máy chủ MCP với các trợ lý AI như Claude, bạn cần cấu hình các thiết lập MCP:

### Cho VS Code

Bạn có thể cài đặt máy chủ MCP Repomix trong VS Code bằng một trong các phương pháp sau:

1. **Sử dụng huy hiệu cài đặt:**

  [![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-VS_Code?style=flat-square&label=Install%20Server&color=0098FF)](vscode:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22repomix%22%2C%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22repomix%22%2C%22--mcp%22%5D%7D)<br>
  [![Install in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-VS_Code_Insiders?style=flat-square&label=Install%20Server&color=24bfa5)](vscode-insiders:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22repomix%22%2C%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22repomix%22%2C%22--mcp%22%5D%7D)

2. **Sử dụng dòng lệnh:**

  ```bash
  code --add-mcp '{"name":"repomix","command":"npx","args":["-y","repomix","--mcp"]}'
  ```

  Cho VS Code Insiders:
  ```bash
  code-insiders --add-mcp '{"name":"repomix","command":"npx","args":["-y","repomix","--mcp"]}'
  ```

### Cho Cline (phần mở rộng VS Code)

Chỉnh sửa file `cline_mcp_settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "repomix": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "repomix",
        "--mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Cho Cursor

Trong Cursor, thêm một máy chủ MCP mới từ `Cursor Settings` > `MCP` > `+ Add new global MCP server` với cấu hình tương tự như Cline.

### Cho Claude Desktop

Chỉnh sửa file `claude_desktop_config.json` với cấu hình tương tự như Cline.

### Cho Claude Code

Để cấu hình Repomix như máy chủ MCP trong [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview), sử dụng lệnh sau:

```bash
claude mcp add repomix -- npx -y repomix --mcp
```

Hoặc, bạn có thể sử dụng **plugin Repomix chính thức** để có trải nghiệm thuận tiện hơn. Các plugin cung cấp lệnh ngôn ngữ tự nhiên và thiết lập dễ dàng hơn. Xem tài liệu [Plugin Claude Code](/vi/guide/claude-code-plugins) để biết chi tiết.

### Sử dụng Docker thay vì npx

Thay vì sử dụng npx, bạn có thể sử dụng Docker để chạy Repomix như một máy chủ MCP:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "repomix-docker": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix",
        "--mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Các công cụ MCP có sẵn

Khi chạy như một máy chủ MCP, Repomix cung cấp các công cụ sau:

### pack_codebase

Công cụ này đóng gói một thư mục code cục bộ thành một file XML để phân tích AI. Nó phân tích cấu trúc codebase, trích xuất nội dung code liên quan và tạo ra một báo cáo toàn diện bao gồm metrics, cây file và nội dung code được định dạng.

**Tham số:**
- `directory`: (Bắt buộc) Đường dẫn tuyệt đối đến thư mục cần đóng gói
- `compress`: (Tùy chọn, mặc định: false) Kích hoạt nén Tree-sitter để trích xuất các chữ ký code cần thiết và cấu trúc trong khi loại bỏ các chi tiết triển khai. Giảm việc sử dụng token khoảng 70% trong khi vẫn bảo toàn ý nghĩa ngữ nghĩa. Thường không cần thiết vì grep_repomix_output cho phép truy xuất nội dung tăng dần. Chỉ sử dụng khi bạn đặc biệt cần toàn bộ nội dung codebase cho các repository lớn.
- `includePatterns`: (Tùy chọn) Chỉ định các file để bao gồm sử dụng các pattern fast-glob. Nhiều pattern có thể được tách bằng dấu phẩy (ví dụ: "**/*.{js,ts}", "src/**,docs/**"). Chỉ các file khớp sẽ được xử lý.
- `ignorePatterns`: (Tùy chọn) Chỉ định các file bổ sung để loại trừ sử dụng các pattern fast-glob. Nhiều pattern có thể được tách bằng dấu phẩy (ví dụ: "test/**,*.spec.js", "node_modules/**,dist/**"). Các pattern này bổ sung cho .gitignore và loại trừ tích hợp.
- `topFilesLength`: (Tùy chọn, mặc định: 10) Số lượng file lớn nhất theo kích thước để hiển thị trong tóm tắt metrics cho phân tích codebase.

**Ví dụ:**
```json
{
  "directory": "/path/to/your/project",
  "compress": false,
  "includePatterns": "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md",
  "ignorePatterns": "**/*.log,tmp/",
  "topFilesLength": 10
}
```

### pack_remote_repository

Công cụ này lấy, clone và đóng gói một repository GitHub thành một file XML để phân tích AI. Nó tự động clone repository từ xa, phân tích cấu trúc của nó và tạo ra một báo cáo toàn diện.

**Tham số:**
- `remote`: (Bắt buộc) URL repository GitHub hoặc định dạng user/repo (ví dụ: "yamadashy/repomix", "https://github.com/user/repo", hoặc "https://github.com/user/repo/tree/branch")
- `compress`: (Tùy chọn, mặc định: false) Kích hoạt nén Tree-sitter để trích xuất các chữ ký code cần thiết và cấu trúc trong khi loại bỏ các chi tiết triển khai. Giảm việc sử dụng token khoảng 70% trong khi vẫn bảo toàn ý nghĩa ngữ nghĩa. Thường không cần thiết vì grep_repomix_output cho phép truy xuất nội dung tăng dần. Chỉ sử dụng khi bạn đặc biệt cần toàn bộ nội dung codebase cho các repository lớn.
- `includePatterns`: (Tùy chọn) Chỉ định các file để bao gồm sử dụng các pattern fast-glob. Nhiều pattern có thể được tách bằng dấu phẩy (ví dụ: "**/*.{js,ts}", "src/**,docs/**"). Chỉ các file khớp sẽ được xử lý.
- `ignorePatterns`: (Tùy chọn) Chỉ định các file bổ sung để loại trừ sử dụng các pattern fast-glob. Nhiều pattern có thể được tách bằng dấu phẩy (ví dụ: "test/**,*.spec.js", "node_modules/**,dist/**"). Các pattern này bổ sung cho .gitignore và loại trừ tích hợp.
- `topFilesLength`: (Tùy chọn, mặc định: 10) Số lượng file lớn nhất theo kích thước để hiển thị trong tóm tắt metrics cho phân tích codebase.

**Ví dụ:**
```json
{
  "remote": "yamadashy/repomix",
  "compress": false,
  "includePatterns": "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md",
  "ignorePatterns": "**/*.log,tmp/",
  "topFilesLength": 10
}
```

### read_repomix_output

Công cụ này đọc nội dung của một file đầu ra được tạo bởi Repomix. Hỗ trợ đọc một phần với chỉ định phạm vi dòng cho các file lớn. Công cụ này được thiết kế cho các môi trường mà việc truy cập hệ thống file trực tiếp bị hạn chế.

**Tham số:**
- `outputId`: (Bắt buộc) ID của file đầu ra Repomix cần đọc
- `startLine`: (Tùy chọn) Số dòng bắt đầu (bắt đầu từ 1, bao gồm). Nếu không chỉ định, đọc từ đầu.
- `endLine`: (Tùy chọn) Số dòng kết thúc (bắt đầu từ 1, bao gồm). Nếu không chỉ định, đọc đến cuối.

**Tính năng:**
- Được thiết kế đặc biệt cho các môi trường dựa trên web hoặc ứng dụng sandbox
- Truy xuất nội dung của các đầu ra được tạo trước đó bằng ID của chúng
- Cung cấp truy cập an toàn đến codebase được đóng gói mà không cần truy cập hệ thống file
- Hỗ trợ đọc một phần cho các file lớn

**Ví dụ:**
```json
{
  "outputId": "8f7d3b1e2a9c6054",
  "startLine": 100,
  "endLine": 200
}
```

### grep_repomix_output

Công cụ này tìm kiếm các pattern trong một file đầu ra Repomix sử dụng chức năng giống grep với cú pháp JavaScript RegExp. Trả về các dòng khớp với các dòng ngữ cảnh tùy chọn xung quanh các kết quả khớp.

**Tham số:**
- `outputId`: (Bắt buộc) ID của file đầu ra Repomix cần tìm kiếm
- `pattern`: (Bắt buộc) Pattern tìm kiếm (cú pháp biểu thức chính quy JavaScript RegExp)
- `contextLines`: (Tùy chọn, mặc định: 0) Số dòng ngữ cảnh để hiển thị trước và sau mỗi kết quả khớp. Bị ghi đè bởi beforeLines/afterLines nếu được chỉ định.
- `beforeLines`: (Tùy chọn) Số dòng ngữ cảnh để hiển thị trước mỗi kết quả khớp (như grep -B). Ưu tiên hơn contextLines.
- `afterLines`: (Tùy chọn) Số dòng ngữ cảnh để hiển thị sau mỗi kết quả khớp (như grep -A). Ưu tiên hơn contextLines.
- `ignoreCase`: (Tùy chọn, mặc định: false) Thực hiện khớp không phân biệt chữ hoa chữ thường

**Tính năng:**
- Sử dụng cú pháp JavaScript RegExp cho khớp pattern mạnh mẽ
- Hỗ trợ các dòng ngữ cảnh để hiểu rõ hơn về các kết quả khớp
- Cho phép điều khiển riêng biệt các dòng ngữ cảnh trước/sau
- Tùy chọn tìm kiếm phân biệt và không phân biệt chữ hoa chữ thường

**Ví dụ:**
```json
{
  "outputId": "8f7d3b1e2a9c6054",
  "pattern": "function\\s+\\w+\\(",
  "contextLines": 3,
  "ignoreCase": false
}
```

### file_system_read_file và file_system_read_directory

Máy chủ MCP của Repomix cung cấp hai công cụ hệ thống file cho phép các trợ lý AI tương tác an toàn với hệ thống file cục bộ:

1. `file_system_read_file`
  - Đọc nội dung file từ hệ thống file cục bộ sử dụng đường dẫn tuyệt đối
  - Bao gồm xác thực bảo mật tích hợp để phát hiện và ngăn chặn truy cập đến các file chứa thông tin nhạy cảm
  - Triển khai xác thực bảo mật sử dụng [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint)
  - Ngăn chặn truy cập đến các file chứa thông tin nhạy cảm (khóa API, mật khẩu, bí mật)
  - Xác thực đường dẫn tuyệt đối để ngăn chặn các cuộc tấn công directory traversal
  - Trả về thông báo lỗi rõ ràng cho các đường dẫn không hợp lệ và vấn đề bảo mật

2. `file_system_read_directory`
  - Liệt kê nội dung của một thư mục sử dụng đường dẫn tuyệt đối
  - Trả về một danh sách được định dạng hiển thị các file và thư mục con với các chỉ báo rõ ràng
  - Hiển thị file và thư mục với các chỉ báo rõ ràng (`[FILE]` hoặc `[DIR]`)
  - Cung cấp điều hướng thư mục an toàn với xử lý lỗi thích hợp
  - Xác thực đường dẫn và đảm bảo chúng là tuyệt đối
  - Hữu ích cho việc khám phá cấu trúc dự án và hiểu tổ chức codebase

Cả hai công cụ đều kết hợp các biện pháp bảo mật mạnh mẽ:
- Xác thực đường dẫn tuyệt đối để ngăn chặn các cuộc tấn công directory traversal
- Kiểm tra quyền để đảm bảo quyền truy cập thích hợp
- Tích hợp với Secretlint để phát hiện thông tin nhạy cảm
- Thông báo lỗi rõ ràng để debug tốt hơn và nhận thức bảo mật

**Ví dụ:**
```typescript
// Đọc một file
const fileContent = await tools.file_system_read_file({
  path: '/absolute/path/to/file.txt'
});

// Liệt kê nội dung thư mục
const dirContent = await tools.file_system_read_directory({
  path: '/absolute/path/to/directory'
});
```

Các công cụ này đặc biệt hữu ích khi các trợ lý AI cần:
- Phân tích các file cụ thể trong codebase
- Điều hướng cấu trúc thư mục
- Xác minh sự tồn tại và khả năng truy cập của file
- Đảm bảo các hoạt động hệ thống file an toàn

## Lợi ích của việc sử dụng Repomix như một Máy chủ MCP

# Định dạng đầu ra

Repomix hỗ trợ bốn định dạng đầu ra:
- XML (mặc định)
- Markdown
- JSON
- Văn bản thuần túy

Bạn có thể chỉ định định dạng đầu ra bằng cách sử dụng tùy chọn `--style`:

```bash
# XML (mặc định)
repomix --style xml

# Markdown
repomix --style markdown

# Văn bản thuần túy
repomix --style plain
```

## Định dạng XML

Định dạng XML là định dạng mặc định và được khuyến nghị cho hầu hết các trường hợp sử dụng. Nó cung cấp cấu trúc rõ ràng và dễ dàng cho AI phân tích.

Ví dụ về đầu ra XML:

```xml
<repository name="repomix" path="/path/to/repomix">
  <stats>
    <file_count>42</file_count>
    <total_lines>1234</total_lines>
    <total_tokens>5678</total_tokens>
  </stats>
  <top_files>
    <file path="src/index.ts" lines="100" tokens="450" />
    <file path="src/utils.ts" lines="80" tokens="320" />
    <!-- ... -->
  </top_files>
  <files>
    <file path="src/index.ts" language="typescript">
      import { processRepository } from './core';
      // Nội dung tệp...
    </file>
    <file path="src/utils.ts" language="typescript">
      export function formatOutput(data) {
        // Nội dung tệp...
      }
    </file>
    <!-- ... -->
  </files>
  <git_logs>
    <git_log_commit>
      <date>2025-08-20 00:47:19 +0900</date>
      <message>feat(cli): Add --include-logs option for git commit history</message>
      <files>
        README.md
        src/cli/cliRun.ts
        src/core/git/gitCommand.ts
        src/core/git/gitLogHandle.ts
        src/core/output/outputGenerate.ts
      </files>
    </git_log_commit>
    <git_log_commit>
      <date>2025-08-21 00:09:43 +0900</date>
      <message>Merge pull request #795 from yamadashy/chore/ratchet-update-ci</message>
      <files>
        .github/workflows/ratchet-update.yml
      </files>
    </git_log_commit>
  </git_logs>
</repository>
```

Định dạng XML đặc biệt hữu ích cho:
- Cung cấp cấu trúc rõ ràng cho AI
- Bao gồm siêu dữ liệu về mỗi tệp (ngôn ngữ, số dòng, số token)
- Phân tích tự động bởi các công cụ

### Tại sao XML là định dạng mặc định?

Repomix sử dụng XML làm định dạng đầu ra mặc định dựa trên nghiên cứu và thử nghiệm rộng rãi. Quyết định này dựa trên bằng chứng thực nghiệm và các cân nhắc thực tế cho phân tích mã được hỗ trợ bởi AI.

Lựa chọn XML của chúng tôi chủ yếu được ảnh hưởng bởi các khuyến nghị chính thức từ các nhà cung cấp AI lớn:
- **Anthropic (Claude)**: Khuyến nghị rõ ràng việc sử dụng thẻ XML để cấu trúc prompt, tuyên bố rằng "Claude đã được tiếp xúc với những prompt như vậy trong quá trình huấn luyện" ([tài liệu](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/use-xml-tags))
- **Google (Gemini)**: Khuyến nghị các định dạng có cấu trúc bao gồm XML cho các tác vụ phức tạp ([tài liệu](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/structure-prompts))
- **OpenAI (GPT)**: Ủng hộ prompting có cấu trúc trong các tình huống phức tạp ([thông báo](https://x.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1890147300493914437), [cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5_prompting_guide))

## Định dạng Markdown

Định dạng Markdown cung cấp đầu ra dễ đọc hơn cho con người, đồng thời vẫn duy trì cấu trúc đủ tốt cho AI.

Ví dụ về đầu ra Markdown:

````markdown
# Repository: repomix

## Stats
- File count: 42
- Total lines: 1234
- Total tokens: 5678

## Top Files
1. src/index.ts (100 lines, 450 tokens)
2. src/utils.ts (80 lines, 320 tokens)
...

## Files

### src/index.ts (typescript)
```typescript
import { processRepository } from './core';
// Nội dung tệp...
```

### src/utils.ts (typescript)
```typescript
export function formatOutput(data) {
  // Nội dung tệp...
}
```

# Git Logs

...
````

Định dạng Markdown đặc biệt hữu ích cho:
- Đọc và xem xét bởi con người
- Chia sẻ codebase trong các tài liệu hoặc wiki
- Sử dụng với các công cụ hỗ trợ Markdown

## Định dạng JSON

```bash
repomix --style json
```

Định dạng JSON cung cấp đầu ra có cấu trúc, có thể truy cập theo chương trình với tên thuộc tính camelCase:

```json
{
  "fileSummary": {
    "generationHeader": "File này là đại diện được hợp nhất của toàn bộ codebase, được kết hợp thành một tài liệu duy nhất bởi Repomix.",
    "purpose": "File này chứa đại diện được đóng gói của toàn bộ nội dung repository...",
    "fileFormat": "Nội dung được tổ chức như sau...",
    "usageGuidelines": "- File này nên được xử lý như chỉ đọc...",
    "notes": "- Một số file có thể đã được loại trừ dựa trên quy tắc .gitignore..."
  },
  "userProvidedHeader": "Văn bản header tùy chỉnh nếu được chỉ định",
  "directoryStructure": "src/
  cli/
    cliOutput.ts
    index.ts
  config/
    configLoader.ts",
  "files": {
    "src/index.js": "// Nội dung file ở đây",
    "src/utils.js": "// Nội dung file ở đây"
  },
  "instruction": "Hướng dẫn tùy chỉnh từ instructionFilePath"
}
```

### Ưu điểm của định dạng JSON

Định dạng JSON lý tưởng cho:
- **Xử lý theo chương trình**: Dễ dàng phân tích và thao tác với thư viện JSON trong bất kỳ ngôn ngữ lập trình nào
- **Tích hợp API**: Tiêu thụ trực tiếp bởi dịch vụ web và ứng dụng
- **Tương thích với công cụ AI**: Định dạng có cấu trúc được tối ưu hóa cho machine learning và hệ thống AI
- **Phân tích dữ liệu**: Trích xuất thông tin cụ thể một cách đơn giản bằng các công cụ như `jq`

### Làm việc với đầu ra JSON sử dụng `jq`

Định dạng JSON giúp dễ dàng trích xuất thông tin cụ thể theo chương trình. Dưới đây là các ví dụ phổ biến:

#### Thao tác file cơ bản
```bash
# Liệt kê tất cả đường dẫn file
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[]'

# Đếm tổng số file
cat repomix-output.json | jq '.files | keys | length'

# Trích xuất nội dung file cụ thể
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files["README.md"]'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files["src/index.js"]'
```

#### Lọc và phân tích file
```bash
# Tìm file theo phần mở rộng
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(endswith(".ts"))'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(endswith(".js") or endswith(".ts"))'

# Lấy file chứa văn bản cụ thể
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | select(.value | contains("function")) | .key'

# Tạo danh sách file với số ký tự
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | "\(.key): \(.value | length) ký tự"'
```

#### Trích xuất metadata
```bash
# Trích xuất cấu trúc thư mục
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.directoryStructure'

# Lấy thông tin tóm tắt file
cat repomix-output.json | jq '.fileSummary.purpose'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.fileSummary.generationHeader'

# Trích xuất header do người dùng cung cấp (nếu tồn tại)
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.userProvidedHeader // "Không có header được cung cấp"'

# Lấy hướng dẫn tùy chỉnh
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.instruction // "Không có hướng dẫn được cung cấp"'
```

#### Phân tích nâng cao
```bash
# Tìm file lớn nhất theo độ dài nội dung
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | [.key, (.value | length)] | @tsv' | sort -k2 -nr | head -10

# Tìm kiếm file chứa các mẫu cụ thể
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | select(.value | test("import.*react"; "i")) | .key'

# Trích xuất đường dẫn file khớp với nhiều phần mở rộng
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(test("\.(js|ts|jsx|tsx)$"))'
```

## Định dạng văn bản thuần túy

Định dạng văn bản thuần túy cung cấp đầu ra đơn giản nhất, không có định dạng đặc biệt.

Ví dụ về đầu ra văn bản thuần túy:

```
Repository: repomix

Stats:
File count: 42
Total lines: 1234
Total tokens: 5678

Top Files:
1. src/index.ts (100 lines, 450 tokens)
2. src/utils.ts (80 lines, 320 tokens)
...

Files:

File: src/index.ts (typescript)
import { processRepository } from './core';
// Nội dung tệp...

File: src/utils.ts (typescript)
export function formatOutput(data) {
  // Nội dung tệp...
}

# Xử lý kho lưu trữ GitHub

Repomix có thể xử lý các kho lưu trữ từ xa mà không cần clone chúng cục bộ, giúp bạn dễ dàng đóng gói và phân tích các dự án mã nguồn mở.

## Tổng quan

Tính năng xử lý kho lưu trữ từ xa cho phép bạn:

- Đóng gói các kho lưu trữ GitHub công khai
- Chỉ định nhánh, thẻ hoặc commit cụ thể
- Xử lý các đường dẫn cụ thể trong kho lưu trữ
- Phân tích các dự án mã nguồn mở mà không cần clone chúng

## Cú pháp cơ bản

Để xử lý một kho lưu trữ từ xa, sử dụng tùy chọn `--remote`:

```bash
repomix --remote <url_or_shorthand>
```

## Định dạng URL được hỗ trợ

Repomix hỗ trợ nhiều định dạng URL khác nhau:

### Định dạng rút gọn

```bash
repomix --remote owner/repo
```

Ví dụ:

```bash
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix
```

### URL đầy đủ

```bash
repomix --remote https://github.com/owner/repo
```

Ví dụ:

```bash
repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix
```

### URL nhánh cụ thể

```bash
repomix --remote https://github.com/owner/repo/tree/branch
```

Ví dụ:

```bash
repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/tree/main
```

### Chỉ định commit cụ thể

Để xử lý một commit cụ thể, sử dụng tùy chọn `--remote-branch` với mã hash commit:

```bash
repomix --remote owner/repo --remote-branch commit_hash
```

Ví dụ:

```bash
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix --remote-branch 836abcd7335137228ad77feb28655d85712680f1
```

### URL đường dẫn cụ thể

```bash
repomix --remote https://github.com/owner/repo/tree/branch/path/to/directory
```

Ví dụ:

```bash
repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/tree/main/src
```

## Ví dụ sử dụng

### Đóng gói kho lưu trữ từ xa với định dạng mặc định

```bash
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix
```

### Đóng gói kho lưu trữ từ xa với định dạng Markdown

```bash
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix --style markdown
```

### Đóng gói một nhánh cụ thể

```bash
repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/tree/develop
```

### Đóng gói một thư mục cụ thể trong kho lưu trữ

```bash
repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/tree/main/src
```

### Đóng gói một commit cụ thể

```bash
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix --remote-branch 836abcd7335137228ad77feb28655d85712680f1
```

## Giới hạn và lưu ý

Khi sử dụng tính năng xử lý kho lưu trữ từ xa, hãy lưu ý những điểm sau:

- **Chỉ hỗ trợ kho lưu trữ công khai**: Tính năng này chỉ hoạt động với các kho lưu trữ GitHub công khai.
- **Giới hạn kích thước**: Các kho lưu trữ rất lớn có thể gặp vấn đề do giới hạn API GitHub.
- **Không có hỗ trợ .gitignore**: Khi xử lý kho lưu trữ từ xa, Repomix không thể tôn trọng các tệp .gitignore vì nó không có quyền truy cập vào cấu hình Git cục bộ.
- **Giới hạn API**: Có thể áp dụng giới hạn tốc độ API GitHub.

## Sử dụng với Docker

Bạn cũng có thể xử lý các kho lưu trữ từ xa bằng cách sử dụng hình ảnh Docker của Repomix:

```bash
docker run -v ./output:/app -it --rm ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix
```

Lệnh này sẽ đóng gói kho lưu trữ từ xa và lưu đầu ra vào thư mục `output` cục bộ của bạn.

# Bảo mật

Repomix tích hợp các tính năng bảo mật mạnh mẽ để giúp ngăn chặn việc vô tình tiết lộ thông tin nhạy cảm khi chia sẻ codebase của bạn với các mô hình ngôn ngữ lớn (LLMs).

## Tổng quan

Khi đóng gói codebase để chia sẻ với AI, có nguy cơ vô tình bao gồm thông tin nhạy cảm như:

- Khóa API
- Mật khẩu
- Khóa bí mật
- Token truy cập
- Thông tin xác thực cơ sở dữ liệu
- Thông tin cá nhân

Repomix giúp giảm thiểu rủi ro này bằng cách tích hợp [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint), một công cụ phát hiện bí mật trong mã.

## Kiểm tra bảo mật tự động

Theo mặc định, Repomix thực hiện kiểm tra bảo mật trên tất cả các tệp trước khi đưa chúng vào đầu ra. Nếu phát hiện thông tin nhạy cảm, Repomix sẽ:

1. Hiển thị cảnh báo
2. Cung cấp thông tin về vị trí của thông tin nhạy cảm
3. Cho bạn tùy chọn để tiếp tục hoặc hủy bỏ quá trình

## Sử dụng kiểm tra bảo mật

### Bật kiểm tra bảo mật (mặc định)

Kiểm tra bảo mật được bật theo mặc định. Không cần thực hiện bất kỳ hành động nào để sử dụng tính năng này.

### Tắt kiểm tra bảo mật

Nếu bạn muốn tắt kiểm tra bảo mật (không được khuyến nghị), bạn có thể sử dụng tùy chọn `--no-security-check`:

```bash
repomix --no-security-check
```

Hoặc trong tệp cấu hình:

```json
{
  "security": {
    "check": false
  }
}
```

### Cấu hình Secretlint tùy chỉnh

Bạn có thể cung cấp cấu hình Secretlint tùy chỉnh để điều chỉnh các quy tắc phát hiện:

```bash
repomix --secretlint-config path/to/secretlint.config.js
```

Hoặc trong tệp cấu hình:

```json
{
  "security": {
    "secretlintConfigPath": "./secretlint.config.js"
  }
}
```

## Các loại bí mật được phát hiện

Repomix có thể phát hiện nhiều loại thông tin nhạy cảm, bao gồm:

- **Khóa API**: AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, GitHub, Stripe, v.v.
- **Mật khẩu**: Mật khẩu được mã hóa cứng trong mã
- **Khóa bí mật**: Khóa SSH, khóa JWT, v.v.
- **Token truy cập**: OAuth, token truy cập cá nhân, v.v.
- **Thông tin xác thực cơ sở dữ liệu**: Chuỗi kết nối, thông tin đăng nhập, v.v.
- **Thông tin cá nhân**: Số điện thoại, địa chỉ email, v.v.

## Thực hành tốt nhất về bảo mật

Ngoài việc sử dụng kiểm tra bảo mật của Repomix, hãy xem xét các thực hành tốt nhất sau:

### 1. Sử dụng biến môi trường

Lưu trữ thông tin nhạy cảm trong biến môi trường thay vì mã hóa cứng chúng trong mã:

```javascript
// Không tốt
const apiKey = "sk_live_1234567890abcdef";

// Tốt
const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;
```

### 2. Sử dụng tệp .env

Lưu trữ biến môi trường trong tệp `.env` và đảm bảo tệp này được thêm vào `.gitignore`:

```
# .env
API_KEY=sk_live_1234567890abcdef
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost/db
```

### 3. Sử dụng quản lý bí mật

Xem xét sử dụng dịch vụ quản lý bí mật như:
- AWS Secrets Manager
- Google Secret Manager
- HashiCorp Vault
- Azure Key Vault

### 4. Xem lại đầu ra

Luôn xem lại đầu ra của Repomix trước khi chia sẻ nó với AI để đảm bảo không có thông tin nhạy cảm nào bị lọt qua.

### 5. Sử dụng tệp .repomixignore

Thêm các tệp có thể chứa thông tin nhạy cảm vào tệp `.repomixignore`:

```
# .repomixignore
.env
config/secrets.yml
credentials/
```

## Xử lý cảnh báo bảo mật

Khi Repomix phát hiện thông tin nhạy cảm, bạn có một số tùy chọn:

1. **Sửa vấn đề**: Xóa hoặc thay thế thông tin nhạy cảm trong mã nguồn
2. **Bỏ qua tệp**: Thêm tệp có vấn đề vào `.repomixignore`
3. **Tiếp tục với rủi ro**: Tiếp tục quá trình đóng gói (không được khuyến nghị)
4. **Tùy chỉnh quy tắc**: Điều chỉnh cấu hình Secretlint để giảm cảnh báo sai

# Sử dụng cơ bản

Repomix được thiết kế để dễ sử dụng với các tùy chọn mặc định hợp lý, đồng thời cung cấp khả năng tùy chỉnh mạnh mẽ cho các trường hợp sử dụng nâng cao.

## Đóng gói kho lưu trữ cục bộ

### Đóng gói toàn bộ kho lưu trữ

Để đóng gói toàn bộ kho lưu trữ hiện tại của bạn, chỉ cần chạy Repomix trong thư mục gốc của dự án:

```bash
repomix
```

Lệnh này sẽ tạo một tệp `repomix-output.xml` trong thư mục hiện tại, chứa toàn bộ codebase của bạn ở định dạng XML.

### Đóng gói một thư mục cụ thể

Để đóng gói một thư mục cụ thể thay vì toàn bộ kho lưu trữ:

```bash
repomix path/to/directory
```

### Đóng gói các tệp cụ thể

Bạn có thể chỉ định các tệp hoặc mẫu cụ thể để đóng gói bằng cách sử dụng tùy chọn `--include`:

```bash
repomix --include "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md"
```

Điều này sẽ đóng gói tất cả các tệp TypeScript trong thư mục `src` và tất cả các tệp Markdown trong toàn bộ dự án.

## Đóng gói kho lưu trữ từ xa

Repomix có thể đóng gói các kho lưu trữ từ xa mà không cần clone chúng cục bộ:

```bash
# Sử dụng định dạng rút gọn
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix

# Sử dụng URL đầy đủ
repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix

# Chỉ định nhánh
repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/tree/main

# Sử dụng URL của commit
repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/commit/836...
```

## Nhập danh sách tệp (stdin)

Truyền đường dẫn tệp qua stdin để có tính linh hoạt tối đa:

```bash
# Sử dụng lệnh find
find src -name "*.ts" -type f | repomix --stdin

# Sử dụng git để lấy các tệp được theo dõi
git ls-files "*.ts" | repomix --stdin

# Sử dụng grep để tìm tệp chứa nội dung cụ thể
grep -l "TODO" **/*.ts | repomix --stdin

# Sử dụng ripgrep để tìm tệp với nội dung cụ thể
rg -l "TODO|FIXME" --type ts | repomix --stdin

# Sử dụng ripgrep (rg) để tìm tệp
rg --files --type ts | repomix --stdin

# Sử dụng sharkdp/fd để tìm tệp
fd -e ts | repomix --stdin

# Sử dụng fzf để chọn từ tất cả các tệp
fzf -m | repomix --stdin

# Chọn tệp tương tác với fzf
find . -name "*.ts" -type f | fzf -m | repomix --stdin

# Sử dụng ls với các mẫu glob
ls src/**/*.ts | repomix --stdin

# Từ một tệp chứa đường dẫn tệp
cat file-list.txt | repomix --stdin

# Nhập trực tiếp với echo
echo -e "src/index.ts\nsrc/utils.ts" | repomix --stdin
```

Tùy chọn `--stdin` cho phép bạn truyền danh sách đường dẫn tệp tới Repomix, mang lại tính linh hoạt tối đa trong việc chọn tệp nào để đóng gói.

Khi sử dụng `--stdin`, các tệp được chỉ định thực sự được thêm vào các mẫu bao gồm. Điều này có nghĩa là hành vi bao gồm và bỏ qua bình thường vẫn áp dụng - các tệp được chỉ định qua stdin vẫn sẽ bị loại trừ nếu chúng khớp với các mẫu bỏ qua.

> [!NOTE]
> Khi sử dụng `--stdin`, đường dẫn tệp có thể là tương đối hoặc tuyệt đối, và Repomix sẽ tự động xử lý việc phân giải đường dẫn và loại bỏ trùng lặp.

## Tùy chọn đầu ra

### Định dạng đầu ra

Repomix hỗ trợ nhiều định dạng đầu ra:

```bash
# XML (mặc định)
repomix --style xml

# Markdown
repomix --style markdown

# JSON
repomix --style json

# Văn bản thuần túy
repomix --style plain
```

### Tên tệp đầu ra tùy chỉnh

Để chỉ định tên tệp đầu ra:

```bash
repomix --output-file my-codebase.xml
```

### Xóa bình luận

Để xóa bình luận khỏi mã nguồn trong đầu ra:

```bash
repomix --remove-comments
```

### Hiển thị số dòng

Để bao gồm số dòng trong đầu ra:

```bash
repomix --show-line-numbers
```

## Bỏ qua tệp và thư mục

### Sử dụng .gitignore

Theo mặc định, Repomix tôn trọng các tệp `.gitignore` của bạn. Để ghi đè hành vi này:

```bash
repomix --no-respect-gitignore
```

### Mẫu bỏ qua tùy chỉnh

Để chỉ định các mẫu bỏ qua bổ sung:

```bash
repomix --ignore "**/*.log,tmp/,**/*.min.js"
```

### Sử dụng .repomixignore

Bạn cũng có thể tạo một tệp `.repomixignore` trong thư mục gốc của dự án để chỉ định các mẫu bỏ qua cụ thể cho Repomix.

## Tùy chọn nâng cao

### Nén mã

```bash
repomix --compress

# Bạn cũng có thể sử dụng nó với kho lưu trữ từ xa:
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix --compress
```

### Tích hợp Git

Bao gồm thông tin Git để cung cấp ngữ cảnh phát triển cho phân tích AI:

```bash
# Bao gồm diff git (các thay đổi chưa commit)
repomix --include-diffs

# Bao gồm nhật ký commit git (50 commit cuối cùng theo mặc định)
repomix --include-logs

# Bao gồm số lượng commit cụ thể
repomix --include-logs --include-logs-count 10

# Bao gồm cả diff và logs
repomix --include-diffs --include-logs
```

Điều này thêm ngữ cảnh có giá trị về:
- **Các thay đổi gần đây**: Git diff hiển thị các sửa đổi chưa commit
- **Các mẫu phát triển**: Git logs tiết lộ tệp nào thường được thay đổi cùng nhau
- **Lịch sử commit**: Các thông điệp commit gần đây cung cấp hiểu biết về trọng tâm phát triển
- **Mối quan hệ tệp**: Hiểu tệp nào được sửa đổi trong cùng một commit

### Tối ưu hóa số lượng token

Hiểu được phân phối token của codebase là rất quan trọng để tối ưu hóa tương tác AI. Sử dụng tùy chọn `--token-count-tree` để trực quan hóa việc sử dụng token trong toàn bộ dự án của bạn:

```bash
repomix --token-count-tree
```

Điều này hiển thị một chế độ xem phân cấp codebase của bạn với số lượng token:

```
🔢 Token Count Tree:
────────────────────
└── src/ (70,925 tokens)
    ├── cli/ (12,714 tokens)
    │   ├── actions/ (7,546 tokens)
    │   └── reporters/ (990 tokens)
    └── core/ (41,600 tokens)
        ├── file/ (10,098 tokens)
        └── output/ (5,808 tokens)
```

Bạn cũng có thể đặt ngưỡng token tối thiểu để tập trung vào các tệp lớn hơn:

```bash
repomix --token-count-tree 1000  # Chỉ hiển thị tệp/thư mục có 1000+ token
```

Điều này giúp bạn:
- **Xác định các tệp nặng token** - có thể vượt quá giới hạn ngữ cảnh AI
- **Tối ưu hóa lựa chọn tệp** - sử dụng các mẫu `--include` và `--ignore`
- **Lập kế hoạch chiến lược nén** - nhắm mục tiêu những đóng góp lớn nhất
- **Cân bằng nội dung vs ngữ cảnh** - khi chuẩn bị mã cho phân tích AI

### Kiểm tra bảo mật

Để tắt kiểm tra bảo mật:

```bash
repomix --no-security-check
```

### Đếm token

Để tắt đếm token:

```bash
repomix --no-token-count
```

## Sử dụng tệp cấu hình

Để tạo một tệp cấu hình mẫu:

```bash
repomix --init
```

Điều này sẽ tạo một tệp `repomix.config.json` mà bạn có thể chỉnh sửa để tùy chỉnh hành vi của Repomix.

Ví dụ về tệp cấu hình:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "style": "markdown",
    "filePath": "custom-output.md",
    "removeComments": true,
    "showLineNumbers": true,
    "topFilesLength": 10
  },
  "ignore": {
    "customPatterns": ["*.test.ts", "docs/**"]
  }
}
```

## Sử dụng với AI

Sau khi tạo tệp đầu ra, bạn có thể tải nó lên các công cụ AI như:

- ChatGPT
- Claude
- Gemini
- Perplexity
- Phind
- Và các LLM khác

Khi tải lên tệp, bạn có thể sử dụng một prompt như:

```
Tệp này chứa toàn bộ codebase của tôi. Tôi muốn bạn:
1. Phân tích cấu trúc tổng thể
2. Xác định các mẫu thiết kế được sử dụng
3. Đề xuất cải tiến
```

## Sử dụng công cụ CLI {#using-the-cli-tool}

Repomix có thể được sử dụng như một công cụ dòng lệnh, cung cấp các tính năng mạnh mẽ và tùy chọn tùy chỉnh.

**Công cụ CLI có thể truy cập các kho lưu trữ riêng tư** vì nó sử dụng git được cài đặt cục bộ của bạn.

### Bắt đầu nhanh

Bạn có thể thử Repomix ngay lập tức trong thư mục dự án của bạn mà không cần cài đặt:

```bash
npx repomix@latest
```

Hoặc cài đặt toàn cục để sử dụng nhiều lần:

```bash
# Cài đặt với npm
npm install -g repomix

# Hoặc với yarn
yarn global add repomix

# Hoặc với bun
bun add -g repomix

# Hoặc với Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
brew install repomix

# Sau đó chạy trong bất kỳ thư mục dự án nào
repomix
```

Vậy là xong! Repomix sẽ tạo một tệp `repomix-output.xml` trong thư mục hiện tại của bạn, chứa toàn bộ kho lưu trữ của bạn ở định dạng thân thiện với AI.



### Cách sử dụng

Để đóng gói toàn bộ kho lưu trữ của bạn:

```bash
repomix
```

Để đóng gói một thư mục cụ thể:

```bash
repomix path/to/directory
```

Để đóng gói các tệp hoặc thư mục cụ thể bằng cách sử dụng [mẫu glob](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax):

```bash
repomix --include "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md"
```

Để loại trừ các tệp hoặc thư mục cụ thể:

```bash
repomix --ignore "**/*.log,tmp/"
```

Để đóng gói một kho lưu trữ từ xa:
```bash
# Sử dụng định dạng rút gọn
npx repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix

# Sử dụng URL đầy đủ (hỗ trợ nhánh và đường dẫn cụ thể)
npx repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix
npx repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/tree/main

# Sử dụng commit cụ thể với --remote-branch
npx repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix --remote-branch 836abcd7335137228ad77feb28655d85712680f1
```

Để khởi tạo một tệp cấu hình mới (`repomix.config.json`):

```bash
repomix --init
```

Sau khi bạn đã tạo tệp đóng gói, bạn có thể sử dụng nó với các công cụ AI Tạo sinh như Claude, ChatGPT và Gemini.

#### Sử dụng Docker

Bạn cũng có thể chạy Repomix bằng Docker 🐳  
Điều này hữu ích nếu bạn muốn chạy Repomix trong môi trường biệt lập hoặc thích sử dụng container.

# 作为库使用 Repomix

除了作为 CLI 工具使用 Repomix 外，您还可以将其功能直接集成到 Node.js 应用程序中。

## 安装

在您的项目中安装 Repomix 作为依赖项：

```bash
npm install repomix
```

## 基本用法

使用 Repomix 最简单的方法是通过 `runCli` 函数，它提供与命令行界面相同的功能：

```javascript
import { runCli, type CliOptions } from 'repomix';

// 使用自定义选项处理当前目录
async function packProject() {
  const options = {
    output: 'output.xml',
    style: 'xml',
    compress: true,
    quiet: true
  } as CliOptions;
  
  const result = await runCli(['.'], process.cwd(), options);
  return result.packResult;
}
```

`result.packResult` 包含有关处理文件的信息，包括：
- `totalFiles`：处理的文件数量
- `totalCharacters`：总字符数
- `totalTokens`：总令牌数（对 LLM 上下文限制有用）
- `fileCharCounts`：每个文件的字符数
- `fileTokenCounts`：每个文件的令牌数

## 处理远程仓库

您可以克隆并处理远程仓库：

```javascript
import { runCli, type CliOptions } from 'repomix';

// 克隆并处理 GitHub 仓库
async function processRemoteRepo(repoUrl) {
  const options = {
    remote: repoUrl,
    output: 'output.xml',
    compress: true
  } as CliOptions;
  
  return await runCli(['.'], process.cwd(), options);
}
```

## 使用核心组件

要获得更多控制，您可以直接使用 Repomix 的低级 API：

```javascript
import { searchFiles, collectFiles, processFiles, TokenCounter } from 'repomix';

async function analyzeFiles(directory) {
  // 查找并收集文件
  const { filePaths } = await searchFiles(directory, { /* 配置 */ });
  const rawFiles = await collectFiles(filePaths, directory);
  const processedFiles = await processFiles(rawFiles, { /* 配置 */ });
  
  // 计算令牌
  const tokenCounter = new TokenCounter('o200k_base');
  
  // 返回分析结果
  return processedFiles.map(file => ({
    path: file.path,
    tokens: tokenCounter.countTokens(file.content)
  }));
}
```

## 实际示例

Repomix 网站（[repomix.com](https://repomix.com)）使用 Repomix 作为库来处理远程仓库。您可以在 [website/server/src/remoteRepo.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/....ts) 中查看实现。

# AI 辅助开发最佳实践：从实践经验谈起

虽然我还没有完成一个大型的 AI 辅助开发项目，但我想分享一下到目前为止从与 AI 合作开发中学到的经验。

## 基本开发方法

在与 AI 合作时，试图一次性实现所有功能可能会导致意外问题和项目停滞。因此，从核心功能开始，一步一步稳扎稳打地构建每个功能是更有效的方法。

### 现有代码的重要性

这种方法之所以有效，是因为通过核心功能的实现，你可以将你理想中的设计和编码风格具体化为实际代码。向 AI 传达项目愿景的最有效方式就是通过反映你的标准和偏好的代码本身。

从核心功能开始，确保每个功能在进入下一个功能之前都能正常工作，这样整个项目就能保持一致性，使 AI 更容易生成更合适的代码。

## 模块化方法

将代码分解成更小的模块至关重要。根据经验，将文件限制在 250 行左右的代码使得向 AI 提供清晰的指示更容易，并使试错过程更有效。虽然令牌计数会是更准确的指标，但对人类开发者来说，行数更容易判断，所以我们使用行数作为参考。

这不仅仅是关于前端、后端和数据库等大单元的分离，而是关于更精细层面的功能划分。例如，在一个功能内部，也要将验证、错误处理等具体功能分离成独立模块。

当然，大单元的分离也很重要，逐步实施模块化方法不仅让指令更清晰，也让 AI 能生成更合适的代码。这种方法不仅对 AI，对人类开发者来说也是有效的。

## 通过测试确保质量

我认为测试在 AI 辅助开发中尤为重要。测试不仅作为质量保证手段，还作为清晰展示代码意图的文档。当要求 AI 实现新功能时，现有的测试代码有效地充当了规范文档。

测试也是验证 AI 生成代码正确性的绝佳工具。例如，当让 AI 为某个模块实现新功能时，预先编写测试用例可以客观评估生成的代码是否符合预期。这与测试驱动开发（TDD）的理念高度契合，在与 AI 协作时特别有效。

## 规划与实现的平衡

在实现大规模功能之前，建议先与 AI 讨论计划。整理需求并考虑架构可以使后续实现更顺畅。先整理需求，然后在新的对话中进行实现是个好方法。

此外，AI 的输出必须经过人工审查，并在必要时进行调整。虽然 AI 输出的质量通常处于中等水平，但与从头开始编写代码相比，仍然可以提高开发速度。

## 结语

通过实践这些方法，你可以充分发挥 AI 的优势，同时构建一个连贯的、高质量的代码库。即使项目规模增长，每个部分都能保持清晰定义和易于管理的状态。

# Agent Skills 生成

Repomix 可以生成 [Claude Agent Skills](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) 格式的输出，创建一个结构化的 Skills 目录，可作为 AI 助手的可重用代码库参考。

当您想要参考远程仓库的实现时，此功能特别强大。通过从开源项目生成 Skills，您可以轻松让 Claude 在您编写代码时参考特定的模式或实现。

Skills 生成不是生成单个打包文件，而是创建一个包含多个参考文件的结构化目录，这些文件针对 AI 理解和 grep 友好搜索进行了优化。

> [!NOTE]
> 这是一个实验性功能。输出格式和选项可能会根据用户反馈在未来版本中发生变化。

## 基本用法

从本地目录生成 Skills：

```bash
# 从当前目录生成 Skills
repomix --skill-generate

# 使用自定义 Skills 名称生成
repomix --skill-generate my-project-reference

# 从特定目录生成
repomix path/to/directory --skill-generate

# 从远程仓库生成
repomix --remote https://github.com/user/repo --skill-generate
```

## Skills 保存位置选择

运行命令时，Repomix 会提示您选择 Skills 的保存位置：

1. **Personal Skills** (`~/.claude/skills/`) - 在您机器上的所有项目中可用
2. **Project Skills** (`.claude/skills/`) - 通过 git 与团队共享

如果 Skills 目录已存在，系统会提示您确认是否覆盖。

> [!TIP]
> 生成 Project Skills 时，建议将其添加到 `.gitignore` 以避免提交大文件：
> ```gitignore
> .claude/skills/repomix-reference-*/
> ```

## 生成的结构

Skills 按以下结构生成：

```text
.claude/skills/<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md                    # Skills 主元数据和文档
└── references/
    ├── summary.md              # 目的、格式和统计信息
    ├── project-structure.md    # 带行数的目录树
    ├── files.md                # 所有文件内容（grep 友好）
    └── tech-stack.md           # 语言、框架、依赖项
```

### 文件说明

#### SKILL.md

主 Skills 文件包含：
- Skills 名称、描述和项目信息
- 文件数、行数和 token 数
- Skills 使用方法概述
- 文件位置和格式说明
- 常见用例和提示

#### references/summary.md

包含：
- **目的**：说明这是供 AI 使用的参考代码库
- **文件结构**：记录每个参考文件的内容
- **使用指南**：如何有效使用 Skills

- **框架**：React、Next.js、Express、Django 等
- **运行时版本**：Node.js、Python、Go 等
- **包管理器**：npm、pnpm、poetry 等
- **依赖项**：所有直接依赖和开发依赖
- **配置文件**：所有检测到的配置文件

检测来源文件：`package.json`、`requirements.txt`、`Cargo.toml`、`go.mod`、`.nvmrc`、`pyproject.toml` 等。

## 自动生成的 Skills 名称

如果未提供名称，Repomix 会使用以下模式自动生成：

```bash
repomix src/ --skill-generate                # → repomix-reference-src
repomix --remote user/repo --skill-generate  # → repomix-reference-repo
repomix --skill-generate CustomName          # → custom-name（规范化为 kebab-case）
```

Skills 名称会：
- 转换为 kebab-case（小写，连字符分隔）
- 限制最多 64 个字符
- 防止路径遍历攻击

## 与 Repomix 选项集成

Skills 生成支持所有标准 Repomix 选项：

```bash
# 使用文件过滤生成 Skills
repomix --skill-generate --include "src/**/*.ts" --ignore "**/*.test.ts"

# 使用压缩生成 Skills
repomix --skill-generate --compress

# 从远程仓库生成 Skills
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix --skill-generate

# 使用特定输出格式选项生成 Skills
repomix --skill-generate --remove-comments --remove-empty-lines
```

### 仅文档 Skills

使用 `--include`，您可以生成仅包含 GitHub 仓库文档的 Skills。当您希望 Claude 在编写代码时参考特定库或框架的文档时，这很有用：

```bash
# Claude Code Action 文档
repomix --remote https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action --include docs --skill-generate

# Vite 文档
repomix --remote https://github.com/vitejs/vite --include docs --skill-generate

# React 文档
repomix --remote https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev --include src/content --skill-generate
```

## 限制

`--skill-generate` 选项不能与以下选项一起使用：
- `--stdout` - Skills 输出需要写入文件系统
- `--copy` - Skills 输出是目录，无法复制到剪贴板

## 使用生成的 Skills

生成后，您可以在 Claude 中使用这些 Skills：

1. **Claude Code**：如果保存到 `~/.claude/skills/` 或 `.claude/skills/`，Skills 会自动可用
2. **Claude Web**：将 Skills 目录上传到 Claude 进行代码库分析
3. **团队共享**：将 `.claude/skills/` 提交到仓库供团队使用

## 示例工作流

### 创建个人参考库

```bash
# 克隆并分析一个有趣的开源项目
repomix --remote facebook/react --skill-generate react-reference

# Skills 保存到 ~/.claude/skills/react-reference/
# 现在您可以在任何 Claude 对话中参考 React 的代码库
```

### 团队项目文档

```bash
# 在您的项目目录中
cd my-project

# 为团队生成 Skills
repomix --skill-generate

# 提示时选择 "Project Skills"
# Skills 保存到 .claude/skills/repomix-reference-my-project/

# 提交并与团队共享
git add .claude/skills/
git commit -m "Add codebase reference Skills"
```

## File: website/client/src/zh-cn/guide/code-compress.md
`````markdown
# 代码压缩
代码压缩是一个强大的功能，它能够在移除实现细节的同时智能提取关键代码结构。在需要减少令牌数量的同时保持代码库的重要结构信息时，这个功能特别有用。

> [!NOTE]
> 这是一个实验性功能，我们将根据用户反馈和实际使用情况积极改进。

## 基本用法

使用 `--compress` 标志启用代码压缩：

```bash
repomix --compress
```

也可以在远程仓库中使用：

```bash
repomix --remote user/repo --compress
```

## 工作原理

压缩算法使用 Tree-sitter 解析处理代码，提取并保留基本结构元素，同时移除实现细节。

压缩会保留：
- 函数和方法签名
- 接口和类型定义
- 类结构和属性
- 重要的结构元素

同时会移除：
- 函数和方法实现
- 循环和条件逻辑细节
- 内部变量声明
- 具体实现代码

### 示例

原始 TypeScript 代码：

```typescript
import { ShoppingItem } from './shopping-item';

/**
 * Calculate the total price of shopping items
 */
const calculateTotal = (
  items: ShoppingItem[]
) => {
  let total = 0;
  for (const item of items) {
    total += item.price * item.quantity;
  }
  return total;
}

// Shopping item interface
interface Item {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  quantity: number;
}
```

压缩后：

```typescript
import { ShoppingItem } from './shopping-item';
⋮----
/**
 * Calculate the total price of shopping items
 */
const calculateTotal = (
  items: ShoppingItem[]
) => {
⋮----
// Shopping item interface
interface Item {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  quantity: number;
}
```

## 配置

你可以在配置文件中启用压缩：

```json
{
  "output": {
    "compress": true
  }
}
```

## 使用场景

代码压缩在以下情况特别有用：
- 分析代码结构和架构
- 减少用于 LLM 处理的令牌数量
- 创建高层次文档
- 理解代码模式和签名
- 共享 API 和接口设计

## 相关选项

你可以将压缩与其他选项结合使用：
- `--remove-comments`: 移除代码注释

`````

## File: website/client/src/zh-cn/guide/comment-removal.md
`````markdown
# 注释移除

Repomix 可以在生成输出文件时自动移除代码中的注释。这有助于减少干扰，让代码更加简洁。

## 使用方法

要启用注释移除，在 `repomix.config.json` 中将 `removeComments` 选项设置为 `true`：

```json
{
  "output": {
    "removeComments": true
  }
}
```

## 支持的语言

Repomix 支持移除多种编程语言的注释，包括：

- JavaScript/TypeScript (`//`, `/* */`)
- Python (`#`, `"""`, `'''`)
- Java (`//`, `/* */`)
- C/C++ (`//`, `/* */`)
- HTML (`<!-- -->`)
- CSS (`/* */`)
- 以及更多语言...

## 示例

以下是 JavaScript 代码示例：

```javascript
// 这是单行注释
function test() {
  /* 这是
     多行注释 */
  return true;
}
```

启用注释移除后，输出将变为：

```javascript
function test() {
  return true;
}
```

## 注意事项

- 注释移除在其他处理步骤（如行号添加）之前执行
- 某些注释，例如 JSDoc 注释，可能会根据语言和上下文保留
- 如果你需要保留某些重要注释，请考虑使用其他方式记录这些信息，例如使用自定义指令

## 建议用法

1. **选择性使用**：
  - 对于需要向 AI 展示实现细节的代码，保留注释
  - 对于主要关注代码结构的分析，移除注释

2. **配合其他功能**：
  - 与 `--remove-empty-lines` 选项组合使用，获得更简洁的输出
  - 使用自定义指令提供额外的上下文信息

3. **性能考虑**：
  - 移除注释可以减少输出文件大小
  - 对于大型代码库特别有用

`````

## File: website/client/src/zh-cn/guide/configuration.md
`````markdown
# 配置

Repomix可以通过配置文件或命令行选项进行配置。配置文件允许您自定义代码库的处理和输出方式。

## 配置文件格式

Repomix支持多种配置文件格式，以提供灵活性和易用性。

Repomix将按以下优先级自动搜索配置文件：

1. **TypeScript** (`repomix.config.ts`, `repomix.config.mts`, `repomix.config.cts`)
2. **JavaScript/ES Module** (`repomix.config.js`, `repomix.config.mjs`, `repomix.config.cjs`)
3. **JSON** (`repomix.config.json5`, `repomix.config.jsonc`, `repomix.config.json`)

### JSON配置

在项目目录中创建配置文件：
```bash
repomix --init
```

这将创建一个带有默认设置的`repomix.config.json`文件。您还可以创建一个全局配置文件，在找不到本地配置时将使用它作为后备：

```bash
repomix --init --global
```

### TypeScript配置

TypeScript配置文件提供最佳的开发体验，具有完整的类型检查和IDE支持。

**安装：**

要使用带有`defineConfig`的TypeScript或JavaScript配置，您需要将Repomix安装为开发依赖：

```bash
npm install -D repomix
```

**示例：**

```typescript
// repomix.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'repomix';

export default defineConfig({
  output: {
    filePath: 'output.xml',
    style: 'xml',
    removeComments: true,
  },
  ignore: {
    customPatterns: ['**/node_modules/**', '**/dist/**'],
  },
});
```

**优势：**
- ✅ IDE中的完整TypeScript类型检查
- ✅ 出色的IDE自动完成和IntelliSense
- ✅ 使用动态值（时间戳、环境变量等）

**动态值示例：**

```typescript
// repomix.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'repomix';

// 生成基于时间戳的文件名
const timestamp = new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 19).replace(/[:.]/g, '-');

export default defineConfig({
  output: {
    filePath: `output-${timestamp}.xml`,
    style: 'xml',
  },
});
```

### JavaScript配置

JavaScript配置文件的工作方式与TypeScript相同，支持`defineConfig`和动态值。

配置文件支持[JSON5](https://json5.org/)语法，允许：
- 注释（单行和多行）
- 对象和数组中的尾随逗号
- 无引号属性名
- 更灵活的字符串语法

## 模式验证

您可以通过添加`$schema`属性为配置文件启用模式验证：

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://repomix.com/schemas/latest/schema.json",
  "output": {
    "filePath": "repomix-output.md",
    "style": "markdown"
  }
}
```

这在支持JSON模式的编辑器中提供自动完成和验证功能。

## 配置文件示例

以下是完整配置文件（`repomix.config.json`）的示例：

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://repomix.com/schemas/latest/schema.json",
  "input": {
    "maxFileSize": 50000000
  },
  "output": {
    "filePath": "repomix-output.xml",
    "style": "xml",
    "parsableStyle": false,
    "compress": false,
    "headerText": "打包文件的自定义头部信息",
    "fileSummary": true,
    "directoryStructure": true,
    "files": true,
    "removeComments": false,
    "removeEmptyLines": false,
    "topFilesLength": 5,
    "showLineNumbers": false,
    "truncateBase64": false,
    "copyToClipboard": false,
    "includeEmptyDirectories": false,
    "git": {
      "sortByChanges": true,
      "sortByChangesMaxCommits": 100,
      "includeDiffs": false,
      "includeLogs": false,
      "includeLogsCount": 50
    }
  },
  "include": ["**/*"],
  "ignore": {
    "useGitignore": true,
    "useDefaultPatterns": true,
    // 模式也可以在 .repomixignore 中指定
    "customPatterns": [
      "additional-folder",
      "**/*.log"
    ],
  },
  "security": {
    "enableSecurityCheck": true
  },
  "tokenCount": {
    "encoding": "o200k_base"
  }
}
```

## 配置文件位置

Repomix按以下顺序查找配置文件：
1. 当前目录中的本地配置文件（优先级：TS > JS > JSON）
   - TypeScript: `repomix.config.ts`, `repomix.config.mts`, `repomix.config.cts`
   - JavaScript: `repomix.config.js`, `repomix.config.mjs`, `repomix.config.cjs`
   - JSON: `repomix.config.json5`, `repomix.config.jsonc`, `repomix.config.json`
2. 全局配置文件（优先级：TS > JS > JSON）
   - Windows：
     - TypeScript: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.ts`, `.mts`, `.cts`
     - JavaScript: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`
     - JSON: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.json5`, `.jsonc`, `.json`
   - macOS/Linux：
     - TypeScript: `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.ts`, `.mts`, `.cts`
     - JavaScript: `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`
     - JSON: `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.json5`, `.jsonc`, `.json`

命令行选项优先于配置文件设置。

## 包含模式

Repomix支持使用[glob模式](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax)指定要包含的文件。这允许更灵活和强大的文件选择：

- 使用`**/*.js`包含任何目录中的所有JavaScript文件
- 使用`src/**/*`包含`src`目录及其子目录中的所有文件
- 组合多个模式，如`["src/**/*.js", "**/*.md"]`以包含`src`中的JavaScript文件和所有Markdown文件

您可以在配置文件中指定包含模式：

```json
{
  "include": ["src/**/*", "tests/**/*.test.js"]
}
```

或使用`--include`命令行选项进行一次性过滤。

## 忽略模式

Repomix提供多种方法来设置忽略模式，以在打包过程中排除特定文件或目录：

- **.gitignore**：默认情况下，使用项目的`.gitignore`文件和`.git/info/exclude`中列出的模式。此行为可以通过`ignore.useGitignore`设置或`--no-gitignore` CLI选项控制。
- **.ignore**：您可以在项目根目录中使用`.ignore`文件，遵循与`.gitignore`相同的格式。ripgrep和the silver searcher等工具也会遵守此文件，减少了维护多个忽略文件的需要。此行为可以通过`ignore.useDotIgnore`设置或`--no-dot-ignore` CLI选项控制。
- **默认模式**：Repomix包含常见排除文件和目录的默认列表（例如node_modules、.git、二进制文件）。此功能可以通过`ignore.useDefaultPatterns`设置或`--no-default-patterns` CLI选项控制。有关详细信息，请参阅[defaultIgnore.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/src/config/defaultIgnore.ts)。
- **.repomixignore**：您可以在项目根目录中创建`.repomixignore`文件来定义Repomix特定的忽略模式。此文件遵循与`.gitignore`相同的格式。
- **自定义模式**：可以使用配置文件中的`ignore.customPatterns`选项指定其他忽略模式。您可以使用`-i, --ignore`命令行选项覆盖此设置。

**优先顺序**（从高到低）：

1. 自定义模式（`ignore.customPatterns`）
2. 忽略文件（`.repomixignore`、`.ignore`、`.gitignore`和`.git/info/exclude`）：
   - 在嵌套目录中时，更深层目录中的文件具有更高优先级
   - 在同一目录中时，这些文件以不特定的顺序合并
3. 默认模式（如果`ignore.useDefaultPatterns`为true且未使用`--no-default-patterns`）

这种方法允许根据项目需求灵活配置文件排除。它通过确保排除安全敏感文件和大型二进制文件来帮助优化生成的打包文件的大小，同时防止机密信息泄漏。

**注意：**默认情况下，二进制文件不包含在打包输出中，但它们的路径列在输出文件的"仓库结构"部分。这提供了仓库结构的完整概述，同时保持打包文件高效且基于文本。有关详细信息，请参阅[二进制文件处理](#二进制文件处理)。

`.repomixignore`示例：
```text
# 缓存目录
.cache/
tmp/

# 构建输出
dist/
build/

# 日志
*.log
```

## 默认忽略模式

当`ignore.useDefaultPatterns`为true时，Repomix自动忽略以下常见模式：
```text
node_modules/**
.git/**
coverage/**
dist/**
```

完整列表请参见[defaultIgnore.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/src/config/defaultIgnore.ts)

## 二进制文件处理

二进制文件（如图像、PDF、编译的二进制文件、归档文件等）经过特殊处理以保持高效的基于文本的输出：

- **文件内容**：二进制文件**不包含**在打包输出中，以保持文件基于文本且对AI处理高效
- **目录结构**：二进制文件**路径被列出**在目录结构部分，提供仓库的完整概述

这种方法确保您获得仓库结构的完整视图，同时保持针对AI消费优化的高效的基于文本的输出。

**示例：**

如果您的仓库包含`logo.png`和`app.jar`：
- 它们将出现在目录结构部分
- 它们的内容将不会包含在文件部分

**目录结构输出：**
```
src/
  index.ts
  utils.ts
assets/
  logo.png
build/
  app.jar
```

这样，AI工具可以理解这些二进制文件存在于您的项目结构中，而无需处理其二进制内容。

**注意：**您可以使用`input.maxFileSize`配置选项（默认值：50MB）控制最大文件大小阈值。大于此限制的文件将被完全跳过。

## 高级功能

### 代码压缩

代码压缩功能（通过`output.compress: true`启用）使用[Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter)智能提取基本代码结构，同时移除实现细节。这有助于在保持重要的结构信息的同时减少令牌数量。

主要优点：
- 显著减少令牌数量
- 保留类和函数签名
- 保持导入和导出
- 保留类型定义和接口
- 移除函数体和实现细节

更多详细信息和示例，请参阅[代码压缩指南](code-compress)。

### Git集成

`output.git`配置提供强大的Git感知功能：

- `sortByChanges`：当设置为true时，文件按Git更改次数（修改该文件的提交数）排序。更改次数较多的文件出现在输出的底部。这有助于优先处理更活跃开发的文件。默认值：`true`
- `sortByChangesMaxCommits`：计算文件更改次数时要分析的最大提交数。默认值：`100`
- `includeDiffs`：当设置为true时，在输出中包含Git差异（同时分别包含工作树和暂存区的更改）。这允许读者查看存储库中的待处理更改。默认值：`false`
- `includeLogs`：当设置为true时，在输出中包含Git日志。显示提交历史的日期、消息和文件路径，帮助AI理解哪些文件通常一起更改。默认值：`false`
- `includeLogsCount`：要包含的Git日志提交数量。控制用于分析开发模式的历史深度。默认值：`50`

配置示例：
```json
{
  "output": {
    "git": {
      "sortByChanges": true,
      "sortByChangesMaxCommits": 100,
      "includeDiffs": true,
      "includeLogs": true,
      "includeLogsCount": 30
    }
  }
}
```

### 安全检查

当`security.enableSecurityCheck`启用时，Repomix使用[Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint)在将代码库包含在输出中之前检测敏感信息。这有助于防止意外暴露：

- API密钥
- 访问令牌
- 私钥
- 密码
- 其他敏感凭据

### 注释移除

当`output.removeComments`设置为`true`时，将从支持的文件类型中移除注释，以减少输出大小并专注于核心代码内容。这在以下情况特别有用：

- 处理大量文档化的代码
- 尝试减少令牌数量
- 专注于代码结构和逻辑

有关支持的语言和详细示例，请参阅[注释移除指南](comment-removal)。

`````markdown
# 自定义指令

Repomix 允许你提供自定义指令，这些指令将被包含在输出文件中。这对于为处理代码库的 AI 系统提供上下文或特定指导非常有用。

## 使用方法

要包含自定义指令，请在仓库根目录创建一个 markdown 文件（例如 `repomix-instruction.md`）。然后，在 `repomix.config.json` 中指定该文件的路径：

```json
{
  "output": {
    "instructionFilePath": "repomix-instruction.md"
  }
}
```

该文件的内容将在输出中的"Instruction"部分中显示。

## 示例

```markdown
# 仓库指令

这个仓库包含了 Repomix 工具的源代码。在分析代码时请遵循以下指导原则：

1. 重点关注 `src/core` 目录中的核心功能
2. 特别注意 `src/core/security` 中的安全检查
3. 忽略 `tests` 目录中的文件

## 代码规范
- 遵循 TypeScript 最佳实践
- 确保所有公共 API 都有适当的文档
- 使用依赖注入模式以便于测试

## 安全考虑
- 确保所有用户输入都经过适当验证
- 避免在日志中记录敏感信息
- 使用安全的依赖版本
```

这将在输出中生成以下部分：

```xml
<instruction>

  [![Install in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-VS_Code_Insiders?style=flat-square&label=Install%20Server&color=24bfa5)](vscode-insiders:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22repomix%22%2C%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22repomix%22%2C%22--mcp%22%5D%7D)

2. **使用命令行：**

  ```bash
  code --add-mcp '{"name":"repomix","command":"npx","args":["-y","repomix","--mcp"]}'
  ```

  对于 VS Code Insiders：
  ```bash
  code-insiders --add-mcp '{"name":"repomix","command":"npx","args":["-y","repomix","--mcp"]}'
  ```

### 对于 Cline（VS Code 扩展）

编辑 `cline_mcp_settings.json` 文件：

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "repomix": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "repomix",
        "--mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### 对于 Cursor

在 Cursor 中，从 `Cursor Settings` > `MCP` > `+ Add new global MCP server` 添加一个新的 MCP 服务器，配置与 Cline 类似。

### 对于 Claude Desktop

使用与 Cline 类似的配置编辑 `claude_desktop_config.json` 文件。

### 对于 Claude Code

要在 [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview) 中配置 Repomix 作为 MCP 服务器，请使用以下命令：

```bash
claude mcp add repomix -- npx -y repomix --mcp
```

或者，您可以使用**官方Repomix插件**获得更便捷的体验。插件提供自然语言命令和更简单的设置。详情请参阅[Claude Code插件](/zh-cn/guide/claude-code-plugins)文档。

### 使用 Docker 代替 npx

您可以使用 Docker 代替 npx 来运行 Repomix 作为 MCP 服务器：

```json

- 支持大文件的部分读取

**示例：**
```json
{
  "outputId": "8f7d3b1e2a9c6054",
  "startLine": 100,
  "endLine": 200
}
```

### grep_repomix_output

此工具使用 JavaScript RegExp 语法的类似 grep 的功能在 Repomix 输出文件中搜索模式。返回匹配行及其周围的可选上下文行。

**参数：**
- `outputId`：（必需）要搜索的 Repomix 输出文件的 ID
- `pattern`：（必需）搜索模式（JavaScript RegExp 正则表达式语法）
- `contextLines`：（可选，默认值：0）在每个匹配项前后显示的上下文行数。如果指定了 beforeLines/afterLines，则被覆盖。
- `beforeLines`：（可选）在每个匹配项前显示的上下文行数（类似 grep -B）。优先于 contextLines。
- `afterLines`：（可选）在每个匹配项后显示的上下文行数（类似 grep -A）。优先于 contextLines。
- `ignoreCase`：（可选，默认值：false）执行不区分大小写的匹配

**功能：**
- 使用 JavaScript RegExp 语法进行强大的模式匹配

  "pattern": "function\\s+\\w+\\(",
  "contextLines": 3,
  "ignoreCase": false
}
```

### file_system_read_file 和 file_system_read_directory

Repomix 的 MCP 服务器提供了两个文件系统工具，允许 AI 助手安全地与本地文件系统交互：

1. `file_system_read_file`
  - 使用绝对路径从本地文件系统读取文件内容
  - 包含内置安全验证以检测和防止访问包含敏感信息的文件
  - 使用 [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint) 实现安全验证
  - 防止访问包含敏感信息的文件（API 密钥、密码、机密）
  - 验证绝对路径以防止目录遍历攻击
  - 对无效路径和安全问题返回清晰的错误消息

2. `file_system_read_directory`
  - 使用绝对路径列出目录的内容
  - 返回显示文件和子目录的格式化列表，带有清晰的指示符
  - 使用清晰的指示符（`[FILE]` 或 `[DIR]`）显示文件和目录
  - 提供安全的目录遍历和适当的错误处理
  - 验证路径并确保使用绝对路径
  - 对探索项目结构和理解代码库组织很有用

这两个工具都包含了强大的安全措施：
- 绝对路径验证以防止目录遍历攻击
- 权限检查以确保适当的访问权限
- 与 Secretlint 集成以检测敏感信息
- 清晰的错误消息以便于调试和安全意识

**示例：**
```typescript
// 读取文件
const fileContent = await tools.file_system_read_file({
  path: '/absolute/path/to/file.txt'
});

// 列出目录内容
const dirContent = await tools.file_system_read_directory({
  path: '/absolute/path/to/directory'
});
```

这些工具在 AI 助手需要执行以下操作时特别有用：
- 分析代码库中的特定文件

### 为什么选择 XML 作为默认格式？

Repomix 基于广泛的研究和测试，选择 XML 作为默认输出格式。这一决定基于实证证据和 AI 辅助代码分析的实际考量。

我们选择 XML 主要受到各大 AI 提供商官方推荐的影响：
- **Anthropic (Claude)**: 明确推荐使用 XML 标签来构建提示，声明"Claude 在训练过程中接触过此类提示"（[文档](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/use-xml-tags)）
- **Google (Gemini)**: 推荐在复杂任务中使用包括 XML 在内的结构化格式（[文档](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/structure-prompts)）
- **OpenAI (GPT)**: 在复杂场景中倡导结构化提示（[公告](https://x.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1890147300493914437)、[cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5_prompting_guide)）

## Markdown 格式

```bash
repomix --style markdown
```

## JSON 格式

```bash
repomix --style json
```

JSON 格式提供使用 camelCase 属性名的结构化、可程序化访问的输出：

```json
{
  "fileSummary": {
    "generationHeader": "本文件是由 Repomix 将整个代码库合并到单个文档中的表示形式。",
    "purpose": "本文件包含整个存储库内容的打包表示...",
    "fileFormat": "内容组织如下...",
    "usageGuidelines": "- 此文件应视为只读...",
    "notes": "- 某些文件可能已根据 .gitignore 规则被排除..."
  },
  "userProvidedHeader": "指定时的自定义标题文本",
  "directoryStructure": "src/
  cli/
    cliOutput.ts
    index.ts
  config/
    configLoader.ts",
  "files": {
    "src/index.js": "// 文件内容",
    "src/utils.js": "// 文件内容"
  },
  "instruction": "来自 instructionFilePath 的自定义指令"
}
```

### JSON 格式的优势

JSON 格式非常适合：
- **程序化处理**: 使用任何编程语言中的 JSON 库都能轻松解析和操作
- **API 集成**: 可直接被 Web 服务和应用程序使用
- **AI 工具兼容性**: 为机器学习和 AI 系统优化的结构化格式
- **数据分析**: 使用 `jq` 等工具轻松提取特定信息

### 使用 `jq` 处理 JSON 输出

JSON 格式使得程序化提取特定信息变得容易。以下是常见示例：

#### 基本文件操作
```bash
# 列出所有文件路径
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[]'

# 计算文件总数
cat repomix-output.json | jq '.files | keys | length'

# 提取特定文件内容
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files["README.md"]'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files["src/index.js"]'
```

#### 文件过滤和分析
```bash
# 按扩展名查找文件
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(endswith(".ts"))'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(endswith(".js") or endswith(".ts"))'

# 查找包含特定文本的文件
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | select(.value | contains("function")) | .key'

# 创建包含字符计数的文件列表
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | "\(.key): \(.value | length) 个字符"'
```

#### 元数据提取
```bash
# 提取目录结构
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.directoryStructure'

# 获取文件概要信息
cat repomix-output.json | jq '.fileSummary.purpose'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.fileSummary.generationHeader'

# 提取用户提供的标题（如果存在）
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.userProvidedHeader // "未提供标题"'

# 获取自定义指令
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.instruction // "未提供指令"'
```

#### 高级分析
```bash
# 按内容长度查找最大的文件
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | [.key, (.value | length)] | @tsv' | sort -k2 -nr | head -10

# 搜索包含特定模式的文件
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | select(.value | test("import.*react"; "i")) | .key'

# 提取匹配多个扩展名的文件路径
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(test("\.(js|ts|jsx|tsx)$"))'
```

## 纯文本格式

```bash
repomix --style plain
```

输出结构：
```text

# 安全性

## 安全检查功能

Repomix 使用 [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint) 检测文件中的敏感信息：
- API 密钥
- 访问令牌
- 认证凭证
- 私钥
- 环境变量

## 配置

安全检查默认启用。

通过命令行禁用：
```bash
repomix --no-security-check
```

或在 `repomix.config.json` 中配置：
```json
{
  "security": {
    "enableSecurityCheck": false
  }
}
```

## 安全措施

1. **二进制文件处理**：二进制文件内容从输出中排除，但其路径在目录结构中列出，以提供完整的仓库概览
2. **Git 感知**：遵循 `.gitignore` 模式
3. **自动检测**：扫描常见安全问题：
    - AWS 凭证
    - 数据库连接字符串
    - 认证令牌
    - 私钥

## 安全检查发现问题时

输出示例：
```bash
🔍 Security Check:
──────────────────
2 suspicious file(s) detected and excluded:
1. config/credentials.json
  - Found AWS access key
2. .env.local
  - Found database password
```

## 最佳实践

1. 分享前务必检查输出内容
2. 使用 `.repomixignore` 排除敏感路径
3. 保持安全检查功能启用
4. 从仓库中移除敏感文件

## 报告安全问题

如果发现安全漏洞，请：
1. 不要创建公开的 Issue
2. 发送邮件至：koukun0120@gmail.com
3. 或使用 [GitHub 安全公告](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/security/advisories/new)

# 基本用法

## 快速开始

打包整个仓库：
```bash
repomix
```

## 常见使用场景

### 打包指定目录
```bash
repomix path/to/directory
```

### 包含特定文件
使用 [glob 模式](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax)：
```bash
repomix --include "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md"
```

### 排除文件
```bash
repomix --ignore "**/*.log,tmp/"
```

### 处理远程仓库
```bash
# 使用 GitHub URL
repomix --remote https://github.com/user/repo

# 使用简写形式
repomix --remote user/repo

# 指定分支/标签/提交
repomix --remote user/repo --remote-branch main
repomix --remote user/repo --remote-branch 935b695
```

### 文件列表输入（stdin）

通过 stdin 传递文件路径以获得终极灵活性：

```bash
# 使用 find 命令
find src -name "*.ts" -type f | repomix --stdin

# 使用 git 获取跟踪的文件
git ls-files "*.ts" | repomix --stdin

# 使用 ripgrep (rg) 查找文件
rg --files --type ts | repomix --stdin

# 使用 grep 查找包含特定内容的文件
grep -l "TODO" **/*.ts | repomix --stdin

# 使用 ripgrep 查找包含特定内容的文件
rg -l "TODO|FIXME" --type ts | repomix --stdin

# 使用 sharkdp/fd 查找文件
fd -e ts | repomix --stdin

# 使用 fzf 从所有文件中选择
fzf -m | repomix --stdin

# 使用 fzf 进行交互式文件选择
find . -name "*.ts" -type f | fzf -m | repomix --stdin

# 使用 ls 和 glob 模式
ls src/**/*.ts | repomix --stdin

# 从包含文件路径的文件中读取
cat file-list.txt | repomix --stdin

# 使用 echo 直接输入
echo -e "src/index.ts\nsrc/utils.ts" | repomix --stdin
```

`--stdin` 选项允许您向 Repomix 传递文件路径列表，在选择要打包的文件时提供终极灵活性。

使用 `--stdin` 时，指定的文件实际上被添加到包含模式中。这意味着正常的包含和忽略行为仍然适用 - 通过 stdin 指定的文件如果匹配忽略模式仍会被排除。

> [!NOTE]
> 使用 `--stdin` 时，文件路径可以是相对路径或绝对路径，Repomix 会自动处理路径解析和去重。

### 代码压缩

```bash
repomix --compress

# 您也可以将其用于远程仓库：
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix --compress
```

### Git 集成

包含Git信息为AI分析提供开发上下文：

```bash
# 包含git差异（未提交的更改）
repomix --include-diffs

# 包含git提交日志（默认最近50个提交）
repomix --include-logs

# 包含特定数量的提交
repomix --include-logs --include-logs-count 10

# 同时包含差异和日志
repomix --include-diffs --include-logs
```

这增加了宝贵的上下文信息：
- **最近更改**：Git差异显示未提交的修改
- **开发模式**：Git日志揭示通常一起更改的文件
- **提交历史**：最近的提交消息提供开发重点的洞察
- **文件关系**：理解在同一提交中修改的文件

### 令牌数量优化

了解代码库的令牌分布对于优化AI交互至关重要。使用 `--token-count-tree` 选项可视化整个项目的令牌使用情况：

```bash
repomix --token-count-tree
```

这将显示带有令牌计数的代码库层次结构视图：

```
🔢 Token Count Tree:
────────────────────
└── src/ (70,925 tokens)
    ├── cli/ (12,714 tokens)
    │   ├── actions/ (7,546 tokens)
    │   └── reporters/ (990 tokens)
    └── core/ (41,600 tokens)
        ├── file/ (10,098 tokens)
        └── output/ (5,808 tokens)
```

您还可以设置最小令牌阈值来关注较大的文件：

```bash
repomix --token-count-tree 1000  # 仅显示拥有1000+令牌的文件/目录
```

这有助于您：
- **识别重令牌文件** - 可能超出AI上下文限制的文件
- **优化文件选择** - 使用 `--include` 和 `--ignore` 模式
- **规划压缩策略** - 针对最大贡献者的策略
- **平衡内容与上下文** - 为AI分析准备代码时的平衡

## 输出格式

### XML（默认）
```bash
repomix --style xml
```

### Markdown
```bash
repomix --style markdown
```

### JSON
```bash
repomix --style json
```

### 纯文本
```bash
repomix --style plain
```

## 其他选项

### 移除注释
```bash
repomix --remove-comments
```

### 显示行号
```bash
repomix --output-show-line-numbers
```

### 复制到剪贴板
```bash
repomix --copy
```

### 禁用安全检查
```bash
repomix --no-security-check
```

## 配置

初始化配置文件：
```bash
repomix --init
```

# 作為庫使用 Repomix

除了作為 CLI 工具使用 Repomix 外，您還可以將其功能直接集成到 Node.js 應用程序中。

## 安裝

在您的項目中安裝 Repomix 作為依賴項：

```bash
npm install repomix
```

## 基本用法

使用 Repomix 最簡單的方法是通過 `runCli` 函數，它提供與命令行界面相同的功能：

```javascript
import { runCli, type CliOptions } from 'repomix';

// 使用自定義選項處理當前目錄
async function packProject() {
  const options = {
    output: 'output.xml',
    style: 'xml',
    compress: true,
    quiet: true
  } as CliOptions;
  
  const result = await runCli(['.'], process.cwd(), options);
  return result.packResult;
}
```

`result.packResult` 包含有關處理文件的信息，包括：
- `totalFiles`：處理的文件數量
- `totalCharacters`：總字符數
- `totalTokens`：總令牌數（對 LLM 上下文限制有用）
- `fileCharCounts`：每個文件的字符數
- `fileTokenCounts`：每個文件的令牌數

## 處理遠端倉庫

您可以克隆並處理遠端倉庫：

```javascript
import { runCli, type CliOptions } from 'repomix';

// 克隆並處理 GitHub 倉庫
async function processRemoteRepo(repoUrl) {
  const options = {
    remote: repoUrl,
    output: 'output.xml',
    compress: true
  } as CliOptions;
  
  return await runCli(['.'], process.cwd(), options);
}
```

## 使用核心組件

要獲得更多控制，您可以直接使用 Repomix 的低級 API：

```javascript
import { searchFiles, collectFiles, processFiles, TokenCounter } from 'repomix';

async function analyzeFiles(directory) {
  // 查找並收集文件
  const { filePaths } = await searchFiles(directory, { /* 配置 */ });
  const rawFiles = await collectFiles(filePaths, directory);
  const processedFiles = await processFiles(rawFiles, { /* 配置 */ });
  
  // 計算令牌
  const tokenCounter = new TokenCounter('o200k_base');
  
  // 返回分析結果
  return processedFiles.map(file => ({
    path: file.path,
    tokens: tokenCounter.countTokens(file.content)
  }));
}
```

## 實際示例

Repomix 網站（[repomix.com](https://repomix.com)）使用 Repomix 作為庫來處理遠端倉庫。您可以在 [website/server/src/remoteRepo.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/....ts) 中查看實現。

## 基本開發方法

在與 AI 合作時，試圖一次性實現所有功能可能會導致意外問題和項目停滯。因此，從核心功能開始，一步一步穩紮穩打地構建每個功能是更有效的方法。

### 現有程式碼的重要性

這種方法之所以有效，是因為通過核心功能的實現，你可以將你理想中的設計和編碼風格具體化為實際程式碼。向 AI 傳達項目願景的最有效方式就是通過反映你的標準和偏好的程式碼本身。

從核心功能開始，確保每個功能在進入下一個功能之前都能正常工作，這樣整個項目就能保持一致性，使 AI 更容易生成更合適的程式碼。

## 模組化方法

將程式碼分解成更小的模組至關重要。根據經驗，將文件限制在 250 行左右的程式碼使得向 AI 提供清晰的指示更容易，並使試錯過程更有效。雖然令牌計數會是更準確的指標，但對人類開發者來說，行數更容易判斷，所以我們使用行數作為參考。

這不僅僅是關於前端、後端和數據庫等大單元的分離，而是關於更精細層面的功能劃分。例如，在一個功能內部，也要將驗證、錯誤處理等具體功能分離成獨立模組。

當然，大單元的分離也很重要，逐步實施模組化方法不僅讓指令更清晰，也讓 AI 能生成更合適的程式碼。這種方法不僅對 AI，對人類開發者來說也是有效的。

## 通過測試確保質量

我認為測試在 AI 輔助開發中尤為重要。測試不僅作為質量保證手段，還作為清晰展示程式碼意圖的文檔。當要求 AI 實現新功能時，現有的測試程式碼有效地充當了規範文檔。

測試也是驗證 AI 生成程式碼正確性的絕佳工具。例如，當讓 AI 為某個模組實現新功能時，預先編寫測試用例可以客觀評估生成的程式碼是否符合預期。這與測試驅動開發（TDD）的理念高度契合，在與 AI 協作時特別有效。

## 規劃與實現的平衡

在實現大規模功能之前，建議先與 AI 討論計劃。整理需求並考慮架構可以使後續實現更順暢。先整理需求，然後在新的對話中進行實現是個好方法。

此外，AI 的輸出必須經過人工審查，並在必要時進行調整。雖然 AI 輸出的質量通常處於中等水準，但與從頭開始編寫程式碼相比，仍然可以提高開發速度。

## 結語

通過實踐這些方法，你可以充分發揮 AI 的優勢，同時構建一個連貫的、高質量的程式碼庫。即使項目規模增長，每個部分都能保持清晰定義和易於管理的狀態。

# Agent Skills 生成

Repomix 可以生成 [Claude Agent Skills](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) 格式的輸出，建立一個結構化的 Skills 目錄，可作為 AI 助手的可重複使用程式碼庫參考。

當您想要參考遠端儲存庫的實作時，此功能特別強大。透過從開源專案生成 Skills，您可以輕鬆讓 Claude 在您編寫程式碼時參考特定的模式或實作。

Skills 生成不是生成單一打包檔案，而是建立一個包含多個參考檔案的結構化目錄，這些檔案針對 AI 理解和 grep 友善搜尋進行了最佳化。

> [!NOTE]
> 這是一個實驗性功能。輸出格式和選項可能會根據使用者回饋在未來版本中發生變化。

## 基本用法

從本地目錄生成 Skills：

```bash
# 從當前目錄生成 Skills
repomix --skill-generate

# 使用自訂 Skills 名稱生成
repomix --skill-generate my-project-reference

# 從特定目錄生成
repomix path/to/directory --skill-generate

# 從遠端儲存庫生成
repomix --remote https://github.com/user/repo --skill-generate
```

## Skills 儲存位置選擇

執行命令時，Repomix 會提示您選擇 Skills 的儲存位置：

1. **Personal Skills** (`~/.claude/skills/`) - 在您機器上的所有專案中可用
2. **Project Skills** (`.claude/skills/`) - 透過 git 與團隊共享

如果 Skills 目錄已存在，系統會提示您確認是否覆蓋。

> [!TIP]
> 生成 Project Skills 時，建議將其新增到 `.gitignore` 以避免提交大型檔案：
> ```gitignore
> .claude/skills/repomix-reference-*/
> ```

## 生成的結構

Skills 按以下結構生成：

```text
.claude/skills/<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md                    # Skills 主要中繼資料和文件
└── references/
    ├── summary.md              # 目的、格式和統計資訊
    ├── project-structure.md    # 帶行數的目錄樹
    ├── files.md                # 所有檔案內容（grep 友善）
    └── tech-stack.md           # 語言、框架、相依性
```

### 檔案說明

#### SKILL.md

主要 Skills 檔案包含：
- Skills 名稱、描述和專案資訊
- 檔案數、行數和 token 數
- Skills 使用方法概述
- 檔案位置和格式說明
- 常見用例和提示

#### references/summary.md

包含：
- **目的**：說明這是供 AI 使用的參考程式碼庫
- **檔案結構**：記錄每個參考檔案的內容
- **使用指南**：如何有效使用 Skills
- **統計資訊**：按檔案類型、語言和最大檔案的分類

#### references/project-structure.md

帶有每個檔案行數的目錄樹，便於檔案發現：

```text
src/
  index.ts (42 lines)
  utils/
    helpers.ts (128 lines)
    math.ts (87 lines)
```

#### references/files.md

所有帶語法高亮標頭的檔案內容，針對 grep 友善搜尋最佳化：

````markdown
## File: src/index.ts
```typescript
import { sum } from './utils/helpers';

export function main() {
  console.log(sum(1, 2));
}
```
````

#### references/tech-stack.md

從相依性檔案自動偵測的技術堆疊：
- **語言**：TypeScript、JavaScript、Python 等
- **框架**：React、Next.js、Express、Django 等
- **執行環境版本**：Node.js、Python、Go 等
- **套件管理器**：npm、pnpm、poetry 等
- **相依性**：所有直接相依和開發相依
- **設定檔**：所有偵測到的設定檔

偵測來源檔案：`package.json`、`requirements.txt`、`Cargo.toml`、`go.mod`、`.nvmrc`、`pyproject.toml` 等。

## 自動生成的 Skills 名稱

如果未提供名稱，Repomix 會使用以下模式自動生成：

```bash
repomix src/ --skill-generate                # → repomix-reference-src
repomix --remote user/repo --skill-generate  # → repomix-reference-repo
repomix --skill-generate CustomName          # → custom-name（規範化為 kebab-case）
```

Skills 名稱會：
- 轉換為 kebab-case（小寫，連字號分隔）
- 限制最多 64 個字元
- 防止路徑遍歷攻擊

## 與 Repomix 選項整合

Skills 生成支援所有標準 Repomix 選項：

```bash
# 使用檔案過濾生成 Skills
repomix --skill-generate --include "src/**/*.ts" --ignore "**/*.test.ts"

# 使用壓縮生成 Skills
repomix --skill-generate --compress

# 從遠端儲存庫生成 Skills
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix --skill-generate

# 使用特定輸出格式選項生成 Skills
repomix --skill-generate --remove-comments --remove-empty-lines
```

### 僅文件 Skills

使用 `--include`，您可以生成僅包含 GitHub 儲存庫文件的 Skills。當您希望 Claude 在編寫程式碼時參考特定函式庫或框架的文件時，這很有用：

```bash
# Claude Code Action 文件
repomix --remote https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action --include docs --skill-generate

# Vite 文件
repomix --remote https://github.com/vitejs/vite --include docs --skill-generate

# React 文件
repomix --remote https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev --include src/content --skill-generate
```

## 限制

`--skill-generate` 選項不能與以下選項一起使用：
- `--stdout` - Skills 輸出需要寫入檔案系統
- `--copy` - Skills 輸出是目錄，無法複製到剪貼簿

## 使用生成的 Skills

生成後，您可以在 Claude 中使用這些 Skills：

1. **Claude Code**：如果儲存到 `~/.claude/skills/` 或 `.claude/skills/`，Skills 會自動可用
2. **Claude Web**：將 Skills 目錄上傳到 Claude 進行程式碼庫分析
3. **團隊共享**：將 `.claude/skills/` 提交到儲存庫供團隊使用

## 範例工作流程

### 建立個人參考庫

```bash
# 複製並分析一個有趣的開源專案
repomix --remote facebook/react --skill-generate react-reference

# Skills 儲存到 ~/.claude/skills/react-reference/
# 現在您可以在任何 Claude 對話中參考 React 的程式碼庫
```

### 團隊專案文件

```bash
# 在您的專案目錄中
cd my-project

# 為團隊生成 Skills
repomix --skill-generate

# 提示時選擇 "Project Skills"
# Skills 儲存到 .claude/skills/repomix-reference-my-project/

# 提交並與團隊共享
git add .claude/skills/
git commit -m "Add codebase reference Skills"
```

# 程式碼壓縮
程式碼壓縮是一個強大的功能，它能夠在移除實現細節的同時智能提取關鍵程式碼結構。在需要減少令牌數量的同時保持程式碼庫的重要結構信息時，這個功能特別有用。

> [!NOTE]
> 這是一個實驗性功能，我們將根據用戶反饋和實際使用情況積極改進。

## 基本用法

使用 `--compress` 標誌啟用程式碼壓縮：

```bash
repomix --compress
```

也可以在遠端倉庫中使用：

```bash
repomix --remote user/repo --compress
```

## 工作原理

壓縮算法使用 Tree-sitter 解析處理程式碼，提取並保留基本結構元素，同時移除實現細節。

壓縮會保留：
- 函數和方法簽名
- 介面和類型定義
- 類結構和屬性
- 重要的結構元素

同時會移除：
- 函數和方法實現
- 迴圈和條件邏輯細節
- 內部變量聲明
- 具體實現程式碼

### 示例

原始 TypeScript 程式碼：

```typescript
import { ShoppingItem } from './shopping-item';

/**
 * Calculate the total price of shopping items
 */
const calculateTotal = (
  items: ShoppingItem[]
) => {
  let total = 0;
  for (const item of items) {
    total += item.price * item.quantity;
  }
  return total;
}

// Shopping item interface
interface Item {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  quantity: number;
}
```

壓縮後：

```typescript
import { ShoppingItem } from './shopping-item';
⋮----
/**
 * Calculate the total price of shopping items
 */
const calculateTotal = (
  items: ShoppingItem[]
) => {
⋮----
// Shopping item interface
interface Item {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  quantity: number;
}
```

## 配置

你可以在配置文件中啟用壓縮：

```json
{
  "output": {
    "compress": true
  }
}
```

## 使用場景

程式碼壓縮在以下情況特別有用：
- 分析程式碼結構和架構
- 減少用於 LLM 處理的令牌數量

## File: website/client/src/zh-tw/guide/comment-removal.md
`````markdown
# 註釋移除

Repomix 可以在生成輸出文件時自動移除程式碼中的註釋。這有助於減少干擾，讓程式碼更加簡潔。

## 使用方法

要啟用註釋移除，在 `repomix.config.json` 中將 `removeComments` 選項設置為 `true`：

```json
{
  "output": {
    "removeComments": true
  }
}
```

## 支援的語言

Repomix 支援移除多種程式設計語言的註釋，包括：

- JavaScript/TypeScript (`//`, `/* */`)
- Python (`#`, `"""`, `'''`)
- Java (`//`, `/* */`)
- C/C++ (`//`, `/* */`)
- HTML (`<!-- -->`)
- CSS (`/* */`)
- 以及更多語言...

## 示例

以下是 JavaScript 程式碼示例：

```javascript
// 這是單行註釋
function test() {
  /* 這是
     多行註釋 */
  return true;
}
```

啟用註釋移除後，輸出將變為：

```javascript
function test() {
  return true;
}
```

## 注意事項

- 註釋移除在其他處理步驟（如行號添加）之前執行
- 某些註釋，例如 JSDoc 註釋，可能會根據語言和上下文保留
- 如果你需要保留某些重要註釋，請考慮使用其他方式記錄這些信息，例如使用自定義指令

## 建議用法

1. **選擇性使用**：
  - 對於需要向 AI 展示實現細節的程式碼，保留註釋
  - 對於主要關注程式碼結構的分析，移除註釋

2. **配合其他功能**：
  - 與 `--remove-empty-lines` 選項組合使用，獲得更簡潔的輸出
  - 使用自定義指令提供額外的上下文信息

3. **效能考慮**：
  - 移除註釋可以減少輸出文件大小
  - 對於大型程式碼庫特別有用

# 設定

Repomix可以透過設定檔或命令列選項進行設定。設定檔允許您自訂程式碼庫的處理和輸出方式。

## 設定檔格式

Repomix支援多種設定檔格式，以提供靈活性和易用性。

Repomix將按以下優先順序自動搜尋設定檔：

1. **TypeScript** (`repomix.config.ts`, `repomix.config.mts`, `repomix.config.cts`)
2. **JavaScript/ES Module** (`repomix.config.js`, `repomix.config.mjs`, `repomix.config.cjs`)
3. **JSON** (`repomix.config.json5`, `repomix.config.jsonc`, `repomix.config.json`)

### JSON設定

在專案目錄中建立設定檔：
```bash
repomix --init
```

這將建立一個帶有預設設定的`repomix.config.json`檔案。您還可以建立一個全域設定檔，在找不到本地設定時將使用它作為後備：

```bash
repomix --init --global
```

### TypeScript設定

TypeScript設定檔提供最佳的開發體驗，具有完整的型別檢查和IDE支援。

**安裝：**

要使用帶有`defineConfig`的TypeScript或JavaScript設定，您需要將Repomix安裝為開發依賴：

```bash
npm install -D repomix
```

**範例：**

```typescript
// repomix.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'repomix';

export default defineConfig({
  output: {
    filePath: 'output.xml',
    style: 'xml',
    removeComments: true,
  },
  ignore: {
    customPatterns: ['**/node_modules/**', '**/dist/**'],
  },
});
```

**優勢：**
- ✅ IDE中的完整TypeScript型別檢查
- ✅ 出色的IDE自動完成和IntelliSense
- ✅ 使用動態值（時間戳記、環境變數等）

**動態值範例：**

```typescript
// repomix.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'repomix';

// 產生基於時間戳記的檔案名稱
const timestamp = new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 19).replace(/[:.]/g, '-');

export default defineConfig({
  output: {
    filePath: `output-${timestamp}.xml`,
    style: 'xml',
  },
});
```

### JavaScript設定

JavaScript設定檔的工作方式與TypeScript相同，支援`defineConfig`和動態值。

設定檔支援[JSON5](https://json5.org/)語法，允許：
- 註解（單行和多行）
- 物件和陣列中的尾隨逗號
- 無引號屬性名
- 更靈活的字串語法

## 模式验证

您可以透過添加`$schema`屬性為設定檔啟用模式验证：

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://repomix.com/schemas/latest/schema.json",
  "output": {
    "filePath": "repomix-output.md",
    "style": "markdown"
  }
}
```

這在支援JSON結構描述的編輯器中提供自動完成和驗證功能。

## 設定檔範例

以下是完整設定檔（`repomix.config.json`）的範例：

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://repomix.com/schemas/latest/schema.json",
  "input": {
    "maxFileSize": 50000000
  },
  "output": {
    "filePath": "repomix-output.xml",
    "style": "xml",
    "parsableStyle": false,
    "compress": false,
    "headerText": "打包檔案的自訂頭部資訊",
    "fileSummary": true,
    "directoryStructure": true,
    "files": true,
    "removeComments": false,
    "removeEmptyLines": false,
    "topFilesLength": 5,
    "showLineNumbers": false,
    "truncateBase64": false,
    "copyToClipboard": false,
    "includeEmptyDirectories": false,
    "git": {
      "sortByChanges": true,
      "sortByChangesMaxCommits": 100,
      "includeDiffs": false,
      "includeLogs": false,
      "includeLogsCount": 50
    }
  },
  "include": ["**/*"],
  "ignore": {
    "useGitignore": true,
    "useDefaultPatterns": true,
    // 模式也可以在 .repomixignore 中指定
    "customPatterns": [
      "additional-folder",
      "**/*.log"
    ],
  },
  "security": {
    "enableSecurityCheck": true
  },
  "tokenCount": {
    "encoding": "o200k_base"
  }
}
```

## 設定檔位置

Repomix按以下順序尋找設定檔：
1. 當前目錄中的本地設定檔（優先順序：TS > JS > JSON）
   - TypeScript: `repomix.config.ts`, `repomix.config.mts`, `repomix.config.cts`
   - JavaScript: `repomix.config.js`, `repomix.config.mjs`, `repomix.config.cjs`
   - JSON: `repomix.config.json5`, `repomix.config.jsonc`, `repomix.config.json`
2. 全域設定檔（優先順序：TS > JS > JSON）
   - Windows：
     - TypeScript: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.ts`, `.mts`, `.cts`
     - JavaScript: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`
     - JSON: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.json5`, `.jsonc`, `.json`
   - macOS/Linux：
     - TypeScript: `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.ts`, `.mts`, `.cts`
     - JavaScript: `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`
     - JSON: `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.json5`, `.jsonc`, `.json`

命令列選項優先於設定檔設定。

## 包含模式

Repomix支援使用[glob模式](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax)指定要包含的檔案。這允許更靈活和強大的檔案選擇：

- 使用`**/*.js`包含任何目錄中的所有JavaScript檔案
- 使用`src/**/*`包含`src`目錄及其子目錄中的所有檔案
- 組合多個模式，如`["src/**/*.js", "**/*.md"]`以包含`src`中的JavaScript檔案和所有Markdown檔案

您可以在設定檔中指定包含模式：

```json
{
  "include": ["src/**/*", "tests/**/*.test.js"]
}
```

或使用`--include`命令列選項進行一次性過濾。

## 忽略模式

Repomix提供多種方法來設定忽略模式，以在打包過程中排除特定檔案或目錄：

- **.gitignore**：預設情況下，使用專案的`.gitignore`檔案和`.git/info/exclude`中列出的模式。此行為可以透過`ignore.useGitignore`設定或`--no-gitignore` CLI選項控制。
- **.ignore**：您可以在專案根目錄中使用`.ignore`檔案，格式與`.gitignore`相同。ripgrep和the silver searcher等工具也會使用此檔案，減少維護多個忽略檔案的需求。此行為可以透過`ignore.useDotIgnore`設定或`--no-dot-ignore` CLI選項控制。
- **預設模式**：Repomix包含常見排除檔案和目錄的預設清單（例如node_modules、.git、二進制檔案）。此功能可以透過`ignore.useDefaultPatterns`設定或`--no-default-patterns` CLI選項控制。有關詳細資訊，請參閱[defaultIgnore.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/src/config/defaultIgnore.ts)。
- **.repomixignore**：您可以在專案根目錄中建立`.repomixignore`檔案來定義Repomix特定的忽略模式。此檔案遵循與`.gitignore`相同的格式。
- **自訂模式**：可以使用設定檔中的`ignore.customPatterns`選項指定其他忽略模式。您可以使用`-i, --ignore`命令列選項覆寫此設定。

**優先順序**（從高到低）：

1. 自訂模式（`ignore.customPatterns`）
2. 忽略檔案（`.repomixignore`、`.ignore`、`.gitignore`和`.git/info/exclude`）：
   - 在巢狀目錄中時，更深層目錄中的檔案具有更高優先順序
   - 在同一目錄中時，這些檔案以不特定的順序合併
3. 預設模式（如果`ignore.useDefaultPatterns`為true且未使用`--no-default-patterns`）

這種方法允許根據專案需求靈活設定檔案排除。它透過確保排除安全敏感檔案和大型二進制檔案來幫助優化產生的打包檔案的大小，同時防止機密資訊外洩。

**注意：**預設情況下，二進制檔案不包含在打包輸出中，但它們的路徑列在輸出檔案的「倉庫結構」部分。這提供了倉庫結構的完整概覽，同時保持打包檔案高效且基於文字。有關詳細資訊，請參閱[二進制檔案處理](#二進制檔案處理)。

`.repomixignore`範例：
```text
# 快取目錄
.cache/
tmp/

# 建置輸出
dist/
build/

# 日誌
*.log
```

## 預設忽略模式

當`ignore.useDefaultPatterns`為true時，Repomix自動忽略以下常見模式：
```text
node_modules/**
.git/**
coverage/**
dist/**
```

完整列表請參見[defaultIgnore.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/src/config/defaultIgnore.ts)

## 二進制檔案處理

二進制檔案（如圖像、PDF、編譯的二進制檔案、歸檔檔案等）經過特殊處理以保持高效的基於文字的輸出：

- **檔案內容**：二進制檔案**不包含**在打包輸出中，以保持檔案基於文字且對AI處理高效
- **目錄結構**：二進制檔案**路徑被列出**在目錄結構部分，提供倉庫的完整概覽

這種方法確保您獲得倉庫結構的完整視圖，同時保持針對AI消費優化的高效的基於文字的輸出。

**範例：**

如果您的倉庫包含`logo.png`和`app.jar`：
- 它們將出現在目錄結構部分
- 它們的內容將不會包含在檔案部分

**目錄結構輸出：**
```
src/
  index.ts
  utils.ts
assets/
  logo.png
build/
  app.jar
```

這樣，AI工具可以理解這些二進制檔案存在於您的專案結構中，而無需處理其二進制內容。

**注意：**您可以使用`input.maxFileSize`設定選項（預設值：50MB）控制最大檔案大小閾值。大於此限制的檔案將被完全跳過。

## 進階功能

### 程式碼壓縮

程式碼壓縮功能（透過`output.compress: true`啟用）使用[Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter)智慧提取基本程式碼結構，同時移除實作細節。這有助於在保持重要的結構資訊的同時減少令牌數量。

主要優點：
- 顯著減少令牌數量
- 保留類別和函式簽名
- 保持匯入和匯出
- 保留型別定義和介面
- 移除函式本體和實作細節

更多詳細資訊和範例，請參閱[程式碼壓縮指南](code-compress)。

### Git整合

`output.git`設定提供強大的Git感知功能：

- `sortByChanges`：當設定為true時，檔案按Git更改次數（修改該檔案的提交數）排序。更改次數較多的檔案出現在輸出的底部。這有助於優先處理更活躍開發的檔案。預設值：`true`
- `sortByChangesMaxCommits`：計算檔案更改次數時要分析的最大提交數。預設值：`100`
- `includeDiffs`：當設定為true時，在輸出中包含Git差異（同時分別包含工作樹和暫存區的更改）。這允許讀者查看儲存庫中的待處理更改。預設值：`false`
- `includeLogs`：當設定為true時，在輸出中包含Git記錄。顯示提交歷史包括日期、訊息和檔案路徑。這有助於AI理解開發模式和檔案關係。預設值：`false`
- `includeLogsCount`：在git記錄中包含的最近提交數量。預設值：`50`

設定範例：
```json
{
  "output": {
    "git": {
      "sortByChanges": true,
      "sortByChangesMaxCommits": 100,
      "includeDiffs": true,
      "includeLogs": true,
      "includeLogsCount": 25
    }
  }
}
```

### 安全檢查

當`security.enableSecurityCheck`啟用時，Repomix使用[Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint)在將程式碼庫包含在輸出中之前檢測敏感資訊。這有助於防止意外暴露：

- API金鑰
- 存取令牌
- 私密金鑰
- 密碼
- 其他敏感憑證

### 註解移除

當`output.removeComments`設定為`true`時，將從支援的檔案類型中移除註解，以減少輸出大小並專注於核心程式碼內容。這在以下情況特別有用：

- 處理大量文件化的程式碼
- 嘗試減少令牌數量
- 專注於程式碼結構和邏輯

有關支援的語言和詳細範例，請參閱[註解移除指南](comment-removal)。

# 自定義指令

Repomix 允許你提供自定義指令，這些指令將被包含在輸出文件中。這對於為處理程式碼庫的 AI 系統提供上下文或特定指導非常有用。

## 使用方法

要包含自定義指令，請在倉庫根目錄創建一個 markdown 文件（例如 `repomix-instruction.md`）。然後，在 `repomix.config.json` 中指定該文件的路徑：

```json
{
  "output": {
    "instructionFilePath": "repomix-instruction.md"
  }
}
```

該文件的內容將在輸出中的「Instruction」部分中顯示。

## 示例

```markdown
# 倉庫指令

這個倉庫包含了 Repomix 工具的原始碼。在分析程式碼時請遵循以下指導原則：

1. 重點關注 `src/core` 目錄中的核心功能
2. 特別注意 `src/core/security` 中的安全檢查
3. 忽略 `tests` 目錄中的文件

## 程式碼規範
- 遵循 TypeScript 最佳實踐
- 確保所有公共 API 都有適當的文檔
- 使用依賴注入模式以便於測試

## 安全考慮
- 確保所有用戶輸入都經過適當驗證
- 避免在日誌中記錄敏感信息
- 使用安全的依賴版本
```

這將在輸出中生成以下部分：

```xml
<instruction>
# 倉庫指令

這個倉庫包含了 Repomix 工具的原始碼。在分析程式碼時請遵循以下指導原則：

1. 重點關注 `src/core` 目錄中的核心功能
2. 特別注意 `src/core/security` 中的安全檢查
3. 忽略 `tests` 目錄中的文件

## 程式碼規範
- 遵循 TypeScript 最佳實踐
- 確保所有公共 API 都有適當的文檔
- 使用依賴注入模式以便於測試

## 安全考慮
- 確保所有用戶輸入都經過適當驗證
- 避免在日誌中記錄敏感信息
- 使用安全的依賴版本
</instruction>
```

## 最佳實踐

1. **保持簡潔明確**：指令應該簡短但詳細
2. **提供具體示例**：在適當的情況下添加程式碼示例
3. **設置優先順序**：將最重要的指令放在前面
4. **包含上下文**：提供專案背景和重要考慮因素
5. **結構化內容**：使用標題和列表使指令易於閱讀

## 注意事項

- 避免在指令中包含敏感信息
- 定期更新指令以反映專案的變化
- 確保指令與專案的其他文檔保持一致
- 使用清晰的層次結構組織內容

通過將 Repomix 集成到 GitHub Actions 工作流中，可以自動打包程式碼庫以供 AI 分析。這對於持續集成（CI）、程式碼審查或為 LLM 工具做準備非常有用。

## 基本用法

在工作流 YAML 文件中添加以下步驟以打包您的倉庫：

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    output: repomix-output.xml
```

## 使用不同的輸出格式

可以使用 `style` 參數指定不同的輸出格式（默認為 `xml`）：

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    output: repomix-output.md
    style: markdown
```

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix (JSON format)
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    output: repomix-output.json
    style: json
```

## 多目錄與壓縮選項

可以指定多個目錄、包含/排除模式，並啟用智能壓縮：

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    directories: src tests
    include: "**/*.ts,**/*.md"
    ignore: "**/*.test.ts"
    output: repomix-output.txt
    compress: true
```

## 上傳輸出文件為 Artifact

將生成的文件作為 artifact 上傳，以便後續步驟或下載：

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    directories: src
    output: repomix-output.xml
    compress: true

- name: Upload Repomix output
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: repomix-output
    path: repomix-output.xml
```

## Action 輸入參數

| 名稱                | 說明                                   | 預設值           |

| `ignore`            | 排除的 glob 模式（逗號分隔）           | `""`           |
| `output`            | 輸出文件路徑                            | `repomix-output.xml`    |
| `style`             | 輸出樣式（xml、markdown、json、plain）        | `xml`            |
| `compress`          | 啟用智能壓縮                            | `true`           |
| `additional-args`   | 傳遞給 repomix CLI 的額外參數           | `""`           |
| `repomix-version`   | 要安裝的 npm 包版本                     | `latest`         |

# MCP伺服器

Repomix 支援 [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)，允許 AI 助手直接與您的程式碼庫交互。當作為 MCP 伺服器運行時，Repomix 提供了工具，使 AI 助手能夠在無需手動準備文件的情況下打包本地或遠端倉庫進行分析。

> [!NOTE]  
> 這是一個實驗性功能，我們將根據用戶反饋和實際使用情況積極改進

## 將 Repomix 作為 MCP 伺服器運行

要將 Repomix 作為 MCP 伺服器運行，請使用 `--mcp` 標誌：

```bash
repomix --mcp
```

這會以 MCP 伺服器模式啟動 Repomix，使其可供支援 Model Context Protocol 的 AI 助手使用。

## 配置 MCP 伺服器

要將 Repomix 作為 MCP 伺服器與 Claude 等 AI 助手一起使用，您需要配置 MCP 設置：

### 對於 VS Code

您可以使用以下方法之一在 VS Code 中安裝 Repomix MCP 伺服器：

1. **使用安裝徽章：**

  [![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-VS_Code?style=flat-square&label=Install%20Server&color=0098FF)](vscode:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22repomix%22%2C%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22repomix%22%2C%22--mcp%22%5D%7D)<br>
  [![Install in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-VS_Code_Insiders?style=flat-square&label=Install%20Server&color=24bfa5)](vscode-insiders:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22repomix%22%2C%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22repomix%22%2C%22--mcp%22%5D%7D)

2. **使用命令行：**

  ```bash
  code --add-mcp '{"name":"repomix","command":"npx","args":["-y","repomix","--mcp"]}'
  ```

  對於 VS Code Insiders：
  ```bash
  code-insiders --add-mcp '{"name":"repomix","command":"npx","args":["-y","repomix","--mcp"]}'
  ```

### 對於 Cline（VS Code 擴展）

編輯 `cline_mcp_settings.json` 文件：

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "repomix": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "repomix",
        "--mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### 對於 Cursor

在 Cursor 中，從 `Cursor Settings` > `MCP` > `+ Add new global MCP server` 添加一個新的 MCP 伺服器，配置與 Cline 類似。

### 對於 Claude Desktop

使用與 Cline 類似的配置編輯 `claude_desktop_config.json` 文件。

### 對於 Claude Code

要在 [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview) 中配置 Repomix 作為 MCP 伺服器，請使用以下命令：

```bash
claude mcp add repomix -- npx -y repomix --mcp
```

或者，您可以使用**官方Repomix外掛**獲得更便捷的體驗。外掛提供自然語言指令和更簡單的設定。詳情請參閱[Claude Code外掛](/zh-tw/guide/claude-code-plugins)文件。

### 使用 Docker 代替 npx

您可以使用 Docker 代替 npx 來運行 Repomix 作為 MCP 伺服器：

```json

- `compress`：（可選，預設值：false）啟用 Tree-sitter 壓縮以提取基本程式碼簽名和結構，同時刪除實現細節。在保持語義含義的同時減少約 70% 的令牌使用量。由於 grep_repomix_output 允許增量內容檢索，通常不需要。僅在您特別需要大型倉庫的整個程式碼庫內容時使用。
- `includePatterns`：（可選）使用 fast-glob 模式指定要包含的文件。多個模式可以用逗號分隔（例如，"**/*.{js,ts}", "src/**,docs/**"）。只有匹配的文件會被處理。
- `ignorePatterns`：（可選）使用 fast-glob 模式指定要排除的其他文件。多個模式可以用逗號分隔（例如，"test/**,*.spec.js", "node_modules/**,dist/**"）。這些模式補充 .gitignore 和內建排除。
- `topFilesLength`：（可選，預設值：10）在程式碼庫分析的指標摘要中顯示的最大文件數（按大小排序）。

**示例：**
```json
{
  "directory": "/path/to/your/project",
  "compress": false,
  "includePatterns": "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md",
  "ignorePatterns": "**/*.log,tmp/",
  "topFilesLength": 10
}
```

### pack_remote_repository

此工具獲取、克隆並將 GitHub 倉庫打包成一個用於 AI 分析的 XML 文件。它自動克隆遠端倉庫，分析其結構，並生成綜合報告。

**參數：**
- `remote`：（必需）GitHub 倉庫 URL 或用戶/倉庫格式（例如，"yamadashy/repomix", "https://github.com/user/repo", 或 "https://github.com/user/repo/tree/branch"）
- `compress`：（可選，預設值：false）啟用 Tree-sitter 壓縮以提取基本程式碼簽名和結構，同時刪除實現細節。在保持語義含義的同時減少約 70% 的令牌使用量。由於 grep_repomix_output 允許增量內容檢索，通常不需要。僅在您特別需要大型倉庫的整個程式碼庫內容時使用。
- `includePatterns`：（可選）使用 fast-glob 模式指定要包含的文件。多個模式可以用逗號分隔（例如，"**/*.{js,ts}", "src/**,docs/**"）。只有匹配的文件會被處理。
- `ignorePatterns`：（可選）使用 fast-glob 模式指定要排除的其他文件。多個模式可以用逗號分隔（例如，"test/**,*.spec.js", "node_modules/**,dist/**"）。這些模式補充 .gitignore 和內建排除。
- `topFilesLength`：（可選，預設值：10）在程式碼庫分析的指標摘要中顯示的最大文件數（按大小排序）。

**示例：**
```json
{
  "remote": "yamadashy/repomix",
  "compress": false,
  "includePatterns": "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md",
  "ignorePatterns": "**/*.log,tmp/",
  "topFilesLength": 10
}
```

### read_repomix_output

此工具讀取 Repomix 生成的輸出文件的內容。支援對大文件進行行範圍指定的部分讀取。此工具專為直接文件系統存取受限的環境而設計。

**參數：**

- `startLine`：（可選）起始行號（從 1 開始，包含）。如果未指定，則從開頭讀取。
- `endLine`：（可選）結束行號（從 1 開始，包含）。如果未指定，則讀取到末尾。

**功能：**
- 專為基於 Web 的環境或沙箱應用程式設計
- 使用其 ID 檢索先前生成的輸出內容
- 無需文件系統存取權限即可安全存取打包的程式碼庫
- 支援大文件的部分讀取

**示例：**
```json
{
  "outputId": "8f7d3b1e2a9c6054",
  "startLine": 100,
  "endLine": 200
}
```

### grep_repomix_output

此工具使用 JavaScript RegExp 語法的類似 grep 的功能在 Repomix 輸出文件中搜尋模式。返回匹配行及其周圍的可選上下文行。

**參數：**
- `outputId`：（必需）要搜尋的 Repomix 輸出文件的 ID
- `pattern`：（必需）搜尋模式（JavaScript RegExp 正規表達式語法）
- `contextLines`：（可選，預設值：0）在每個匹配項前後顯示的上下文行數。如果指定了 beforeLines/afterLines，則被覆蓋。
- `beforeLines`：（可選）在每個匹配項前顯示的上下文行數（類似 grep -B）。優先於 contextLines。
- `afterLines`：（可選）在每個匹配項後顯示的上下文行數（類似 grep -A）。優先於 contextLines。
- `ignoreCase`：（可選，預設值：false）執行不區分大小寫的匹配

**功能：**
- 使用 JavaScript RegExp 語法進行強大的模式匹配

  "contextLines": 3,
  "ignoreCase": false
}
```

### file_system_read_file 和 file_system_read_directory

Repomix 的 MCP 伺服器提供了兩個文件系統工具，允許 AI 助手安全地與本地文件系統交互：

1. `file_system_read_file`
  - 使用絕對路徑從本地文件系統讀取文件內容
  - 包含內建安全驗證以檢測和防止存取包含敏感資訊的文件
  - 使用 [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint) 實現安全驗證
  - 防止存取包含敏感資訊的文件（API 金鑰、密碼、機密）
  - 驗證絕對路徑以防止目錄遍歷攻擊
  - 對無效路徑和安全問題返回清晰的錯誤訊息

2. `file_system_read_directory`
  - 使用絕對路徑列出目錄的內容
  - 返回顯示文件和子目錄的格式化列表，帶有清晰的指示符
  - 使用清晰的指示符（`[FILE]` 或 `[DIR]`）顯示文件和目錄
  - 提供安全的目錄遍歷和適當的錯誤處理
  - 驗證路徑並確保使用絕對路徑
  - 對探索專案結構和理解程式碼庫組織很有用

這兩個工具都包含了強大的安全措施：
- 絕對路徑驗證以防止目錄遍歷攻擊
- 權限檢查以確保適當的存取權限
- 與 Secretlint 整合以檢測敏感資訊

    "notes": "- 某些文件可能已根據 .gitignore 規則被排除..."
  },
  "userProvidedHeader": "指定時的自訂標題文字",
  "directoryStructure": "src/
  cli/
    cliOutput.ts
    index.ts
  config/
    configLoader.ts",
  "files": {
    "src/index.js": "// 文件內容",
    "src/utils.js": "// 文件內容"
  },
  "instruction": "來自 instructionFilePath 的自訂指令"
}
```

### JSON 格式的優勢

JSON 格式非常適合：
- **程式化處理**: 使用任何程式語言中的 JSON 函式庫都能輕鬆解析和操作
- **API 整合**: 可直接被 Web 服務和應用程式使用
- **AI 工具相容性**: 為機器學習和 AI 系統優化的結構化格式
- **資料分析**: 使用 `jq` 等工具輕鬆提取特定資訊

### 使用 `jq` 處理 JSON 輸出

JSON 格式使得程式化提取特定資訊變得容易。以下是常見範例：

#### 基本文件操作

```bash
# 使用完整 URL
repomix --remote https://github.com/user/repo

# 使用 GitHub 簡寫
repomix --remote user/repo
```

## 分支和提交選擇

```bash
# 指定分支
repomix --remote user/repo --remote-branch main

# 指定標籤
repomix --remote user/repo --remote-branch v1.0.0

# 指定提交哈希
repomix --remote user/repo --remote-branch 935b695
```

## 系統要求

- 必須安裝 Git
- 需要網絡連接
- 需要倉庫的讀取權限

## 輸出控制

```bash
# 自定義輸出位置
repomix --remote user/repo -o custom-output.xml

# 使用 XML 格式
repomix --remote user/repo --style xml

# 移除註釋
repomix --remote user/repo --remove-comments
```

## Docker 使用方法

```bash
# 在當前目錄處理並輸出
docker run -v .:/app -it --rm ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix \
  --remote user/repo

# 輸出到指定目錄
docker run -v ./output:/app -it --rm ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix \
  --remote user/repo
```

`````

## File: website/client/src/zh-tw/guide/security.md
`````markdown
# 安全性

## 安全檢查功能

Repomix 使用 [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint) 檢測文件中的敏感信息：
- API 密鑰
- 訪問令牌
- 認證憑證
- 私鑰
- 環境變量

## 配置

安全檢查預設啟用。

通過命令行禁用：
```bash
repomix --no-security-check
```

或在 `repomix.config.json` 中配置：
```json
{
  "security": {
    "enableSecurityCheck": false
  }
}
```

## 安全措施

1. **二進制文件處理**：二進制文件內容從輸出中排除，但其路徑在目錄結構中列出，以提供完整的倉庫概覽
2. **Git 感知**：遵循 `.gitignore` 模式
3. **自動檢測**：掃描常見安全問題：
    - AWS 憑證
    - 數據庫連接字符串
    - 認證令牌
    - 私鑰

## 安全檢查發現問題時

輸出示例：
```bash
🔍 Security Check:
──────────────────
2 suspicious file(s) detected and excluded:
1. config/credentials.json
  - Found AWS access key
2. .env.local
  - Found database password
```

## 最佳實踐

1. 分享前務必檢查輸出內容
2. 使用 `.repomixignore` 排除敏感路徑
3. 保持安全檢查功能啟用
4. 從倉庫中移除敏感文件

## 報告安全問題

如果發現安全漏洞，請：
1. 不要創建公開的 Issue
2. 發送郵件至：koukun0120@gmail.com
3. 或使用 [GitHub 安全公告](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/security/advisories/new)

`````

## File: website/client/src/zh-tw/guide/usage.md
`````markdown
# 基本用法

## 快速開始

打包整個倉庫：
```bash
repomix
```

## 常見使用場景

### 打包指定目錄
```bash
repomix path/to/directory
```

### 包含特定文件
使用 [glob 模式](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax)：
```bash
repomix --include "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md"
```

### 排除文件
```bash
repomix --ignore "**/*.log,tmp/"
```

### 處理遠端倉庫
```bash
# 使用 GitHub URL
repomix --remote https://github.com/user/repo

# 使用簡寫形式
repomix --remote user/repo

# 指定分支/標籤/提交
repomix --remote user/repo --remote-branch main
repomix --remote user/repo --remote-branch 935b695
```

### 文件列表輸入（stdin）

通過 stdin 傳遞文件路徑以獲得終極靈活性：

```bash
# 使用 find 命令
find src -name "*.ts" -type f | repomix --stdin

# 使用 git 獲取追蹤的文件
git ls-files "*.ts" | repomix --stdin

# 使用 ripgrep (rg) 查找文件
rg --files --type ts | repomix --stdin

# 使用 grep 查找包含特定內容的文件
grep -l "TODO" **/*.ts | repomix --stdin

# 使用 ripgrep 查找包含特定內容的文件
rg -l "TODO|FIXME" --type ts | repomix --stdin

# 使用 sharkdp/fd 查找文件
fd -e ts | repomix --stdin

# 使用 fzf 從所有文件中選擇
fzf -m | repomix --stdin

# 使用 fzf 進行互動式文件選擇
find . -name "*.ts" -type f | fzf -m | repomix --stdin

# 使用 ls 和 glob 模式
ls src/**/*.ts | repomix --stdin

# 從包含文件路徑的文件中讀取
cat file-list.txt | repomix --stdin

# 使用 echo 直接輸入
echo -e "src/index.ts\nsrc/utils.ts" | repomix --stdin
```

`--stdin` 選項允許您向 Repomix 傳遞文件路徑列表，在選擇要打包的文件時提供終極靈活性。

使用 `--stdin` 時，指定的文件實際上被添加到包含模式中。這意味著正常的包含和忽略行為仍然適用 - 通過 stdin 指定的文件如果匹配忽略模式仍會被排除。

> [!NOTE]
> 使用 `--stdin` 時，文件路徑可以是相對路徑或絕對路徑，Repomix 會自動處理路徑解析和去重。

### 程式碼壓縮

```bash
repomix --compress

# 您也可以將其用於遠端倉庫：
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix --compress
```

### Git整合

包含Git資訊以為AI分析提供開發脈絡：

```bash
# 包含git差異（未提交的變更）
repomix --include-diffs

# 包含git提交記錄（預設為最後50次提交）
repomix --include-logs

# 包含特定數量的提交
repomix --include-logs --include-logs-count 10

# 同時包含差異和記錄
repomix --include-diffs --include-logs
```

這會添加有價值的脈絡資訊：
- **最近的變更**：Git差異顯示未提交的修改
- **開發模式**：Git記錄揭示哪些檔案通常一起變更
- **提交歷史**：最近的提交訊息提供對開發重點的洞察
- **檔案關係**：了解哪些檔案在同一次提交中被修改

### 權杖數量最佳化

了解程式碼庫的權杖分布對於最佳化AI互動至關重要。使用 `--token-count-tree` 選項可視化整個專案的權杖使用情況：

```bash
repomix --token-count-tree
```

這將顯示帶有權杖計數的程式碼庫層次結構視圖：

```
🔢 Token Count Tree:
────────────────────
└── src/ (70,925 tokens)
    ├── cli/ (12,714 tokens)
    │   ├── actions/ (7,546 tokens)
    │   └── reporters/ (990 tokens)
    └── core/ (41,600 tokens)
        ├── file/ (10,098 tokens)
        └── output/ (5,808 tokens)
```

您還可以設定最小權杖閾值來關注較大的檔案：

```bash
repomix --token-count-tree 1000  # 僅顯示擁有1000+權杖的檔案/目錄
```

這有助於您：
- **識別重權杖檔案** - 可能超出AI上下文限制的檔案
- **最佳化檔案選擇** - 使用 `--include` 和 `--ignore` 模式
- **規劃壓縮策略** - 針對最大貢獻者的策略
- **平衡內容與上下文** - 為AI分析準備程式碼時的平衡

# Repomix Website

This directory contains the source code for the Repomix website, built with [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)

## Prerequisites

- Docker must be installed on your system

## Development

To start the development server:

```bash
# Start the website development server
npm run website

# Access the website at http://localhost:5173/
```

## Documentation

When updating documentation, you only need to update the English version (`client/src/en/`).
The maintainers will handle translations to other languages.

## Building for Production

To build the website for production:

```bash
npm run website:build
```

The built files will be available in the `client/dist` directory.

# Repomix MCP Server Installation Guide

This guide is specifically designed for AI agents like Cline to install and configure the Repomix MCP server for use with LLM applications like Claude Desktop, Cursor, Roo Code, and Cline.

## Overview

Repomix MCP server is a powerful tool that packages local or remote codebases into AI-friendly formats. It allows AI assistants to analyze code efficiently without manual file preparation, optimizing token usage and providing consistent output.

## Prerequisites

Before installation, you need:

1. Node.js 20.0.0 or higher
2. npm (Node Package Manager)

## Installation and Configuration

### Configure MCP Settings

Add the Repomix MCP server configuration to your MCP settings file based on your LLM client:

#### Configuration File Locations

- Cline (VS Code Extension): `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`
- Roo Code (VS Code Extension): `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`
- Claude Desktop: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Cursor: `[project root]/.cursor/mcp.json`

Add this configuration to your chosen client's settings file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "repomix": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "repomix",
        "--mcp"
      ],
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration uses `npx` to run Repomix directly without requiring a global installation.

## Available MCP Tools

Once configured, you'll have access to these Repomix tools:

### 1. pack_codebase

This tool packages a local code directory into a consolidated XML file for AI analysis. It analyzes the codebase structure, extracts relevant code content, and generates a comprehensive report including metrics, file tree, and formatted code content.

**Parameters:**
- `directory`: (Required) Absolute path to the directory to pack
- `compress`: (Optional, default: false) Enable Tree-sitter compression to extract essential code signatures and structure while removing implementation details. Reduces token usage by ~70% while preserving semantic meaning. Generally not needed since grep_repomix_output allows incremental content retrieval. Use only when you specifically need the entire codebase content for large repositories.
- `includePatterns`: (Optional) Specify files to include using fast-glob patterns. Multiple patterns can be comma-separated (e.g., "**/*.{js,ts}", "src/**,docs/**"). Only matching files will be processed.
- `ignorePatterns`: (Optional) Specify additional files to exclude using fast-glob patterns. Multiple patterns can be comma-separated (e.g., "test/**,*.spec.js", "node_modules/**,dist/**"). These patterns supplement .gitignore and built-in exclusions.
- `topFilesLength`: (Optional, default: 10) Number of largest files by size to display in the metrics summary for codebase analysis.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "directory": "/path/to/your/project",
  "compress": false,
  "includePatterns": "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md",
  "ignorePatterns": "**/*.log,tmp/",
  "topFilesLength": 10
}
```

### 2. attach_packed_output

This tool attaches an existing Repomix packed output file for AI analysis. It allows you to work with previously generated packed repositories without requiring re-processing.

**Parameters:**
- `path`: (Required) Path to a directory containing repomix-output.xml or direct path to a packed repository XML file
- `topFilesLength`: (Optional, default: 10) Number of largest files by size to display in the metrics summary

**Features:**
- Accepts either a directory containing a repomix-output.xml file or a direct path to an XML file
- Registers the file with the MCP server and returns the same structure as the pack_codebase tool
- Provides secure access to existing packed outputs without requiring re-processing
- Useful for working with previously generated packed repositories

**Example:**
```json
{
  "path": "/path/to/directory/with/repomix-output.xml",
  "topFilesLength": 10
}
```

### 3. pack_remote_repository

This tool fetches, clones, and packages a GitHub repository into a consolidated XML file for AI analysis. It automatically clones the remote repository, analyzes its structure, and generates a comprehensive report.

**Parameters:**
- `remote`: (Required) GitHub repository URL or user/repo format (e.g., "yamadashy/repomix", "https://github.com/user/repo", or "https://github.com/user/repo/tree/branch")
- `compress`: (Optional, default: false) Enable Tree-sitter compression to extract essential code signatures and structure while removing implementation details. Reduces token usage by ~70% while preserving semantic meaning. Generally not needed since grep_repomix_output allows incremental content retrieval. Use only when you specifically need the entire codebase content for large repositories.
- `includePatterns`: (Optional) Specify files to include using fast-glob patterns. Multiple patterns can be comma-separated (e.g., "**/*.{js,ts}", "src/**,docs/**"). Only matching files will be processed.
- `ignorePatterns`: (Optional) Specify additional files to exclude using fast-glob patterns. Multiple patterns can be comma-separated (e.g., "test/**,*.spec.js", "node_modules/**,dist/**"). These patterns supplement .gitignore and built-in exclusions.
- `topFilesLength`: (Optional, default: 10) Number of largest files by size to display in the metrics summary for codebase analysis.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "remote": "yamadashy/repomix",
  "compress": false,
  "includePatterns": "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md",
  "ignorePatterns": "**/*.log,tmp/",
  "topFilesLength": 10
}
```

### 4. read_repomix_output

This tool reads the contents of a Repomix-generated output file. Supports partial reading with line range specification for large files. This tool is designed for environments where direct file system access is limited.

**Parameters:**
- `outputId`: (Required) ID of the Repomix output file to read
- `startLine`: (Optional) Starting line number (1-based, inclusive). If not specified, reads from beginning.
- `endLine`: (Optional) Ending line number (1-based, inclusive). If not specified, reads to end.

**Features:**
- Specifically designed for web-based environments or sandboxed applications
- Retrieves the content of previously generated outputs using their ID
- Provides secure access to packed codebase without requiring file system access
- Supports partial reading for large files

**Example:**
```json
{
  "outputId": "8f7d3b1e2a9c6054",
  "startLine": 100,
  "endLine": 200
}
```

### 5. grep_repomix_output

This tool searches for patterns in a Repomix output file using grep-like functionality with JavaScript RegExp syntax. Returns matching lines with optional context lines around matches.

**Parameters:**
- `outputId`: (Required) ID of the Repomix output file to search
- `pattern`: (Required) Search pattern (JavaScript RegExp regular expression syntax)
- `contextLines`: (Optional, default: 0) Number of context lines to show before and after each match. Overridden by beforeLines/afterLines if specified.
- `beforeLines`: (Optional) Number of context lines to show before each match (like grep -B). Takes precedence over contextLines.
- `afterLines`: (Optional) Number of context lines to show after each match (like grep -A). Takes precedence over contextLines.
- `ignoreCase`: (Optional, default: false) Perform case-insensitive matching

**Features:**
- Uses JavaScript RegExp syntax for powerful pattern matching
- Supports context lines for better understanding of matches
- Allows separate control of before/after context lines
- Case-sensitive and case-insensitive search options

**Example:**
```json
{
  "outputId": "8f7d3b1e2a9c6054",
  "pattern": "function\\s+\\w+\\(",
  "contextLines": 3,
  "ignoreCase": false
}
```

### 6. file_system_read_file

This tool reads a file from the local file system using an absolute path. Includes built-in security validation to detect and prevent access to files containing sensitive information.

**Parameters:**
- `path`: (Required) Absolute path to the file to read

**Security features:**
- Implements security validation using [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint)
- Prevents access to files containing sensitive information (API keys, passwords, secrets)
- Validates absolute paths to prevent directory traversal attacks

**Example:**
```json
{
  "path": "/absolute/path/to/file.txt"
}
```

### 7. file_system_read_directory

This tool lists the contents of a directory using an absolute path. Returns a formatted list showing files and subdirectories with clear indicators.

**Parameters:**
- `path`: (Required) Absolute path to the directory to list

**Features:**
- Shows files and directories with clear indicators (`[FILE]` or `[DIR]`)
- Provides safe directory traversal with proper error handling
- Validates paths and ensures they are absolute
- Useful for exploring project structure and understanding codebase organization

**Example:**
```json
{
  "path": "/absolute/path/to/directory"
}
```

## Verify Installation

To verify the installation is working:

1. Restart your LLM application (Cline, Claude Desktop, etc.)
2. Test the connection by running a simple command like:
  ```
  Please package the local directory /path/to/project for AI analysis using Repomix.
  ```
  or
  ```
  Please fetch and package the GitHub repository yamadashy/repomix for AI analysis.
  ```

## Usage Examples

Here are some examples of how to use Repomix MCP server with AI assistants:

### Local Codebase Analysis

```
Can you analyze the code in my project at /path/to/project? Please use Repomix to package it first.
```

### Remote Repository Analysis

```
I'd like you to review the code in the GitHub repository username/repo. Please use Repomix to package it first.
```

### Specific File Types Analysis

```
Please package my project at /path/to/project, but only include TypeScript files and markdown documentation.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **MCP server connection issues**
  - Verify the syntax in your MCP settings file is correct
  - Ensure you have an active internet connection (needed for npx to fetch the package)
  - Check if any other MCP servers are causing conflicts

2. **Packaging failures**
  - Verify the specified directory or repository exists
  - Check if you have sufficient disk space
  - For remote repositories, ensure you have internet connectivity
  - Try with simpler parameters first, then add complexity

3. **JSON parsing errors in configuration**
  - Make sure your MCP settings file is properly formatted
  - Verify all paths use forward slashes, even on Windows
  - Check for any missing commas or brackets in the configuration

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Using the CLI Tool `>_`

You can try Repomix instantly in your project directory without installation:

```bash
npx repomix@latest
```

Or install globally for repeated use:

```bash
# Install using npm
npm install -g repomix

# Alternatively using yarn
yarn global add repomix

# Alternatively using bun
bun add -g repomix

# Alternatively using Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
brew install repomix

# Then run in any project directory
repomix
```

That's it! Repomix will generate a `repomix-output.xml` file in your current directory, containing your entire
repository in an AI-friendly format.

You can then send this file to an AI assistant with a prompt like:

```
This file contains all the files in the repository combined into one.
I want to refactor the code, so please review it first.
```

![Repomix File Usage 1](website/client/src/public/images/docs/repomix-file-usage-1.png)

When you propose specific changes, the AI might be able to generate code accordingly. With features like Claude's
Artifacts, you could potentially output multiple files, allowing for the generation of multiple interdependent pieces of
code.

## 📊 Usage

To pack your entire repository:

```bash
repomix
```

To pack a specific directory:

```bash
repomix path/to/directory
```

To pack specific files or directories
using [glob patterns](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax):

```bash
repomix --include "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md"
```

To exclude specific files or directories:

```bash
repomix --ignore "**/*.log,tmp/"
```

To pack a remote repository:

```bash
repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix

# You can also use GitHub shorthand:
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix

# You can specify the branch name, tag, or commit hash:
repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix --remote-branch main

# Or use a specific commit hash:
repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix --remote-branch 935b695

# Another convenient way is specifying the branch's URL
repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/tree/main

# Commit's URL is also supported
repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/commit/836...

```

To pack files from a file list (pipe via stdin):

```bash
# Using find command
find src -name "*.ts" -type f | repomix --stdin

# Using git to get tracked files
git ls-files "*.ts" | repomix --stdin

# Using grep to find files containing specific content
grep -l "TODO" **/*.ts | repomix --stdin

# Using ripgrep to find files with specific content
rg -l "TODO|FIXME" --type ts | repomix --stdin

# Using ripgrep (rg) to find files
rg --files --type ts | repomix --stdin

# Using sharkdp/fd to find files
fd -e ts | repomix --stdin

# Using fzf to select from all files
fzf -m | repomix --stdin

# Interactive file selection with fzf
find . -name "*.ts" -type f | fzf -m | repomix --stdin

# Using ls with glob patterns
ls src/**/*.ts | repomix --stdin

# From a file containing file paths
cat file-list.txt | repomix --stdin

# Direct input with echo
echo -e "src/index.ts\nsrc/utils.ts" | repomix --stdin
```

The `--stdin` option allows you to pipe a list of file paths to Repomix, giving you ultimate flexibility in selecting which files to pack.

When using `--stdin`, the specified files are effectively added to the include patterns. This means that the normal include and ignore behavior still applies - files specified via stdin will still be excluded if they match ignore patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> When using `--stdin`, file paths can be relative or absolute, and Repomix will automatically handle path resolution and deduplication.

To include git logs in the output:

```bash
# Include git logs with default count (50 commits)
repomix --include-logs

# Include git logs with specific commit count
repomix --include-logs --include-logs-count 10

# Combine with diffs for comprehensive git context
repomix --include-logs --include-diffs
```

The git logs include commit dates, messages, and file paths for each commit, providing valuable context for AI analysis of code evolution and development patterns.

To compress the output:

```bash
repomix --compress

# You can also use it with remote repositories:
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix --compress
```

To initialize a new configuration file (`repomix.config.json`):

```bash
repomix --init
```

Once you have generated the packed file, you can use it with Generative AI tools like ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Perplexity, Gemini, Gemma, Llama, Grok, and more.

### Docker Usage 🐳

You can also run Repomix using Docker.  
This is useful if you want to run Repomix in an isolated environment or prefer using containers.

Basic usage (current directory):

```bash
docker run -v .:/app -it --rm ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix
```

To pack a specific directory:

```bash
docker run -v .:/app -it --rm ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix path/to/directory
```

Process a remote repository and output to a `output` directory:

```bash
docker run -v ./output:/app -it --rm ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix
```

### Prompt Examples

Once you have generated the packed file with Repomix, you can use it with AI tools like ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Perplexity, Gemini, Gemma, Llama, Grok, and more.
Here are some example prompts to get you started:

#### Code Review and Refactoring

For a comprehensive code review and refactoring suggestions:

```
This file contains my entire codebase. Please review the overall structure and suggest any improvements or refactoring opportunities, focusing on maintainability and scalability.
```

Feel free to join the discussion and share your own experiences! Your insights could help others make better use of
Repomix.

### Output File Format

Repomix generates a single file with clear separators between different parts of your codebase.  
To enhance AI comprehension, the output file begins with an AI-oriented explanation, making it easier for AI models to
understand the context and structure of the packed repository.

#### XML Format (default)

The XML format structures the content in a hierarchical manner:

```xml
This file is a merged representation of the entire codebase, combining all repository files into a single document.

<file_summary>
  (Metadata and usage AI instructions)
</file_summary>

<directory_structure>
src/
cli/
cliOutput.ts
index.ts

(...remaining directories)
</directory_structure>

<files>
<file path="src/index.js">
  // File contents here
</file>

(...remaining files)
</files>

<instruction>
(Custom instructions from `output.instructionFilePath`)
</instruction>
```

For those interested in the potential of XML tags in AI contexts:  
https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/use-xml-tags

> When your prompts involve multiple components like context, instructions, and examples, XML tags can be a
> game-changer. They help Claude parse your prompts more accurately, leading to higher-quality outputs.

This means that the XML output from Repomix is not just a different format, but potentially a more effective way to feed
your codebase into AI systems for analysis, code review, or other tasks.

#### Markdown Format

To generate output in Markdown format, use the `--style markdown` option:

```bash
repomix --style markdown
```

The Markdown format structures the content in a hierarchical manner:

````markdown
This file is a merged representation of the entire codebase, combining all repository files into a single document.

# File Summary

(Metadata and usage AI instructions)

# Repository Structure

```
src/
  cli/
    cliOutput.ts
    index.ts
```

(...remaining directories)

# Repository Files

## File: src/index.js

```
// File contents here
```

(...remaining files)

# Instruction

(Custom instructions from `output.instructionFilePath`)
````

This format provides a clean, readable structure that is both human-friendly and easily parseable by AI systems.

#### JSON Format

To generate output in JSON format, use the `--style json` option:

```bash
repomix --style json
```

The JSON format structures the content as a hierarchical JSON object with camelCase property names:

```json
{
  "fileSummary": {
    "generationHeader": "This file is a merged representation of the entire codebase, combined into a single document by Repomix.",
    "purpose": "This file contains a packed representation of the entire repository's contents...",
    "fileFormat": "The content is organized as follows...",
    "usageGuidelines": "- This file should be treated as read-only...",
    "notes": "- Some files may have been excluded based on .gitignore, .ignore, and .repomixignore rules..."
  },
  "userProvidedHeader": "Custom header text if specified",
  "directoryStructure": "src/\n  cli/\n    cliOutput.ts\n    index.ts\n  config/\n    configLoader.ts",
  "files": {
    "src/index.js": "// File contents here",
    "src/utils.js": "// File contents here"
  },
  "instruction": "Custom instructions from instructionFilePath"
}
```

This format is ideal for:
- **Programmatic processing**: Easy to parse and manipulate with JSON libraries
- **API integration**: Direct consumption by web services and applications  
- **AI tool compatibility**: Structured format for machine learning and AI systems
- **Data analysis**: Straightforward extraction of specific information using tools like `jq`

##### Working with JSON Output Using `jq`

The JSON format makes it easy to extract specific information programmatically:

```bash
# List all file paths
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[]'

# Count total number of files
cat repomix-output.json | jq '.files | keys | length'

# Extract specific file content
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files["README.md"]'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files["src/index.js"]'

# Find files by extension
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(endswith(".ts"))'

# Get files containing specific text
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | select(.value | contains("function")) | .key'

# Extract directory structure
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.directoryStructure'

# Get file summary information
cat repomix-output.json | jq '.fileSummary.purpose'
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.fileSummary.generationHeader'

# Extract user-provided header (if exists)
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.userProvidedHeader // "No header provided"'

# Create a file list with sizes
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | "\(.key): \(.value | length) characters"'
```

#### Plain Text Format

To generate output in plain text format, use the `--style plain` option:

```bash
repomix --style plain
```

```text
This file is a merged representation of the entire codebase, combining all repository files into a single document.

# Output to stdout
repomix --stdout > custom-output.txt

# Send output to stdout, then pipe into another command (for example, simonw/llm)
repomix --stdout | llm "Please explain what this code does."

# Custom output with compression
repomix --compress

# Process specific files
repomix --include "src/**/*.ts" --ignore "**/*.test.ts"

# Remote repository with branch
repomix --remote https://github.com/user/repo/tree/main

# Remote repository with commit
repomix --remote https://github.com/user/repo/commit/836abcd7335...

# Remote repository with shorthand
repomix --remote user/repo
```

### Updating Repomix

To update a globally installed Repomix:

```bash
# Using npm
npm update -g repomix

# Using yarn
yarn global upgrade repomix

# Using bun
bun update -g repomix
```

Using `npx repomix` is generally more convenient as it always uses the latest version.

### Remote Repository Processing

Repomix supports processing remote Git repositories without the need for manual cloning. This feature allows you to
quickly analyze any public Git repository with a single command.

To process a remote repository, use the `--remote` option followed by the repository URL:

```bash
repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix
```

You can also use GitHub's shorthand format:

```bash
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix
```

You can specify the branch name, tag, or commit hash:

```bash
# Using --remote-branch option
repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix --remote-branch main

# Using branch's URL
repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/tree/main
```

Or use a specific commit hash:

```bash
# Using --remote-branch option
repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix --remote-branch 935b695

# Using commit's URL
repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/commit/836...
```

### Code Compression

The `--compress` option utilizes [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) to perform intelligent code extraction, focusing on essential function and class signatures while removing implementation details. This can help reduce token count while retaining important structural information.

```bash
repomix --compress
```

For example, this code:

```typescript
import { ShoppingItem } from './shopping-item';

/**
 * Calculate the total price of shopping items
 */
const calculateTotal = (
  items: ShoppingItem[]
) => {
  let total = 0;
  for (const item of items) {
    total += item.price * item.quantity;
  }
  return total;
}

// Shopping item interface
interface Item {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  quantity: number;
}
```

Will be compressed to:

```typescript
import { ShoppingItem } from './shopping-item';
⋮----
/**
 * Calculate the total price of shopping items
 */
const calculateTotal = (
  items: ShoppingItem[]
) => {
⋮----
// Shopping item interface
interface Item {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  quantity: number;
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> This is an experimental feature that we'll be actively improving based on user feedback and real-world usage

### Token Count Optimization

Understanding your codebase's token distribution is crucial for optimizing AI interactions. Use the `--token-count-tree` option to visualize token usage across your project:

```bash
repomix --token-count-tree
```

This displays a hierarchical view of your codebase with token counts:

```
🔢 Token Count Tree:
────────────────────
└── src/ (70,925 tokens)
    ├── cli/ (12,714 tokens)
    │   ├── actions/ (7,546 tokens)
    │   └── reporters/ (990 tokens)
    └── core/ (41,600 tokens)
        ├── file/ (10,098 tokens)
        └── output/ (5,808 tokens)
```

You can also set a minimum token threshold to focus on larger files:

```bash
repomix --token-count-tree 1000  # Only show files/directories with 1000+ tokens
```

This helps you:
- **Identify token-heavy files** that might exceed AI context limits
- **Optimize file selection** using `--include` and `--ignore` patterns  
- **Plan compression strategies** by targeting the largest contributors
- **Balance content vs. context** when preparing code for AI analysis

### MCP Server Integration

Repomix supports the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), allowing AI assistants to directly interact with your codebase. When run as an MCP server, Repomix provides tools that enable AI assistants to package local or remote repositories for analysis without requiring manual file preparation.

```bash
repomix --mcp
```

#### Configuring MCP Servers

To use Repomix as an MCP server with AI assistants like Claude, you need to configure the MCP settings:

**For VS Code:**

You can install the Repomix MCP server in VS Code using one of these methods:

1. **Using the Install Badge:**

  [![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Install_Server-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=repomix&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22repomix%22%2C%22--mcp%22%5D%7D)
  [![Install in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-Install_Server-24bfa5?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=repomix&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22repomix%22%2C%22--mcp%22%5D%7D&quality=insiders)

2. **Using the Command Line:**

  ```bash
  code --add-mcp '{"name":"repomix","command":"npx","args":["-y","repomix","--mcp"]}'
  ```

  For VS Code Insiders:
  ```bash
  code-insiders --add-mcp '{"name":"repomix","command":"npx","args":["-y","repomix","--mcp"]}'
  ```

**For Cline (VS Code extension):**

Edit the `cline_mcp_settings.json` file:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "repomix": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "repomix",
        "--mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**For Cursor:**

In Cursor, add a new MCP server from `Cursor Settings` > `MCP` > `+ Add new global MCP server` with a configuration similar to Cline.

**For Claude Desktop:**

Edit the `claude_desktop_config.json` file with similar configuration to Cline's config.

**For Claude Code:**

To configure Repomix as an MCP server in [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview), use the following command:

```bash
claude mcp add repomix -- npx -y repomix --mcp
```

Alternatively, you can use the official Repomix plugins (see [Claude Code Plugins](#claude-code-plugins) section below).

**Using Docker instead of npx:**

You can use Docker as an alternative to npx for running Repomix as an MCP server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "repomix-docker": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix",
        "--mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Once configured, your AI assistant can directly use Repomix's capabilities to analyze codebases without manual file preparation, making code analysis workflows more efficient.

#### Available MCP Tools

When running as an MCP server, Repomix provides the following tools:

1. **pack_codebase**: Package a local code directory into a consolidated XML file for AI analysis
  - Parameters:
    - `directory`: Absolute path to the directory to pack
    - `compress`: (Optional, default: false) Enable Tree-sitter compression to extract essential code signatures and structure while removing implementation details.

### Agent Skills Generation

Repomix can generate [Claude Agent Skills](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) format output, creating a structured Skills directory that can be used as a reusable codebase reference for AI assistants. This feature is particularly powerful when you want to reference implementations from remote repositories.

#### Basic Usage

```bash
# Generate Skills from local directory
repomix --skill-generate

# Generate with custom Skills name
repomix --skill-generate my-project-reference

# Generate from remote repository
repomix --remote https://github.com/user/repo --skill-generate
```

When you run the command, Repomix prompts you to choose where to save the Skills:

1. **Personal Skills** (`~/.claude/skills/`) - Available across all projects on your machine
2. **Project Skills** (`.claude/skills/`) - Shared with your team via git

#### Generated Structure

The Skills are generated with the following structure:

```text
.claude/skills/<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md                 # Main Skills metadata & documentation
└── references/
    ├── summary.md           # Purpose, format, and statistics
    ├── project-structure.md # Directory tree with line counts
    ├── files.md             # All file contents (grep-friendly)
    └── tech-stack.md        # Languages, frameworks, dependencies
```

#### What's Included

- **SKILL.md**: Contains Skills metadata, file/line/token counts, overview, and usage instructions
- **summary.md**: Explains the Skills' purpose, usage guidelines, and provides statistics breakdown by file type and language
- **project-structure.md**: Directory tree with line counts per file for easy file discovery
- **files.md**: All file contents with syntax highlighting headers, optimized for grep-friendly searching
- **tech-stack.md**: Auto-detected tech stack from dependency files (`package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `Cargo.toml`, etc.)

#### Auto-Generated Skills Names

If no name is provided, Repomix auto-generates one:

```bash
repomix src/ --skill-generate                # → repomix-reference-src
repomix --remote user/repo --skill-generate  # → repomix-reference-repo
repomix --skill-generate CustomName          # → custom-name (normalized to kebab-case)
```

#### Integration with Repomix Features

Skills generation respects all standard Repomix options:

```bash
# Generate Skills with file filtering
repomix --skill-generate --include "src/**/*.ts" --ignore "**/*.test.ts"

# Generate Skills with compression
repomix --skill-generate --compress

# Generate Skills from remote repository
repomix --remote yamadashy/repomix --skill-generate
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Repomix supports multiple configuration file formats for flexibility and ease of use.

### Configuration File Formats

Repomix will automatically search for configuration files in the following priority order:

1. **TypeScript** (`repomix.config.ts`, `repomix.config.mts`, `repomix.config.cts`)
2. **JavaScript/ES Module** (`repomix.config.js`, `repomix.config.mjs`, `repomix.config.cjs`)
3. **JSON** (`repomix.config.json5`, `repomix.config.jsonc`, `repomix.config.json`)

#### JSON Configuration

Create a `repomix.config.json` file in your project root:

```bash
repomix --init
```

This will create a `repomix.config.json` file with default settings.

#### TypeScript Configuration

TypeScript configuration files provide the best developer experience with full type checking and IDE support.

**Installation:**

To use TypeScript or JavaScript configuration with `defineConfig`, you need to install Repomix as a dev dependency:

```bash
npm install -D repomix
```

**Example:**

```typescript
// repomix.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'repomix';

export default defineConfig({
  output: {
    filePath: 'output.xml',
    style: 'xml',
    removeComments: true,
  },
  ignore: {
    customPatterns: ['**/node_modules/**', '**/dist/**'],
  },
});
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Full TypeScript type checking in your IDE
- ✅ Excellent IDE autocomplete and IntelliSense
- ✅ Use dynamic values (timestamps, environment variables, etc.)

**Dynamic Values Example:**

```typescript
// repomix.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'repomix';

// Generate timestamp-based filename
const timestamp = new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 19).replace(/[:.]/g, '-');

export default defineConfig({
  output: {
    filePath: `output-${timestamp}.xml`,
    style: 'xml',
  },
});
```

#### JavaScript Configuration

JavaScript configuration files work the same as TypeScript, supporting `defineConfig` and dynamic values.

### Configuration Options

See [tiktoken model.py](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken/blob/main/tiktoken/model.py#L24) for encoding details. | `"o200k_base"`         |

The configuration file supports [JSON5](https://json5.org/) syntax, which allows:
- Comments (both single-line and multi-line)
- Trailing commas in objects and arrays
- Unquoted property names
- More relaxed string syntax

### Schema Validation

You can enable schema validation for your configuration file by adding the `$schema` property:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://repomix.com/schemas/latest/schema.json",
  "output": {
    "filePath": "repomix-output.xml",
    "style": "xml"
  }
}
```

This provides auto-completion and validation in editors that support JSON schema.

### Example Configuration

Example configuration:

```json5
{
  "$schema": "https://repomix.com/schemas/latest/schema.json",
  "input": {
    "maxFileSize": 50000000
  },
  "output": {
    "filePath": "repomix-output.xml",
    "style": "xml",
    "parsableStyle": false,
    "compress": false,
    "headerText": "Custom header information for the packed file.",
    "fileSummary": true,
    "directoryStructure": true,
    "files": true,
    "removeComments": false,
    "removeEmptyLines": false,
    "topFilesLength": 5,
    "tokenCountTree": false, // or true, or a number like 10 for minimum token threshold
    "showLineNumbers": false,
    "truncateBase64": false,
    "copyToClipboard": false,
    "includeEmptyDirectories": false,
    "git": {
      "sortByChanges": true,
      "sortByChangesMaxCommits": 100,
      "includeDiffs": false,
      "includeLogs": false,
      "includeLogsCount": 50
    }
  },
  "include": ["**/*"],
  "ignore": {
    "useGitignore": true,
    "useDefaultPatterns": true,
    // Patterns can also be specified in .repomixignore
    "customPatterns": [
      "additional-folder",
      "**/*.log"
    ],
  },
  "security": {
    "enableSecurityCheck": true
  },
  "tokenCount": {
    "encoding": "o200k_base"
  }
}
```

### Global Configuration

To create a global configuration file:

```bash
repomix --init --global
```

The global configuration file will be created in:

- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repomix\repomix.config.json`
- macOS/Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/repomix/repomix.config.json` or `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.json`

Note: Local configuration (if present) takes precedence over global configuration.

### Include and Ignore

#### Include Patterns

Repomix now supports specifying files to include
using [glob patterns](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax). This allows for more
flexible and powerful file selection:

- Use `**/*.js` to include all JavaScript files in any directory
- Use `src/**/*` to include all files within the `src` directory and its subdirectories
- Combine multiple patterns like `["src/**/*.js", "**/*.md"]` to include JavaScript files in `src` and all Markdown
  files

#### Ignore Patterns

Repomix offers multiple methods to set ignore patterns for excluding specific files or directories during the packing
process:

- **.gitignore**: By default, patterns listed in your project's `.gitignore` files and `.git/info/exclude` are used. This behavior can be controlled with the `ignore.useGitignore` setting or the `--no-gitignore` cli option.
- **.ignore**: You can use a `.ignore` file in your project root, following the same format as `.gitignore`. This file is respected by tools like ripgrep and the silver searcher, reducing the need to maintain multiple ignore files. This behavior can be controlled with the `ignore.useDotIgnore` setting or the `--no-dot-ignore` cli option.
- **Default patterns**: Repomix includes a default list of commonly excluded files and directories (e.g., node_modules,
  .git, binary files). This feature can be controlled with the `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` setting or the `--no-default-patterns` cli option. Please
  see [defaultIgnore.ts](src/config/defaultIgnore.ts) for more details.
- **.repomixignore**: You can create a `.repomixignore` file in your project root to define Repomix-specific ignore
  patterns. This file follows the same format as `.gitignore`.
- **Custom patterns**: Additional ignore patterns can be specified using the `ignore.customPatterns` option in the
  configuration file. You can overwrite this setting with the `-i, --ignore` command line option.

Priority Order (from highest to lowest):

1. Custom patterns (`ignore.customPatterns`)
2. Ignore files (`.repomixignore`, `.ignore`, `.gitignore`, and `.git/info/exclude`):
   - When in nested directories, files in deeper directories have higher priority
   - When in the same directory, these files are merged in no particular order
3. Default patterns (if `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` is true and `--no-default-patterns` is not used)

This approach allows for flexible file exclusion configuration based on your project's needs. It helps optimize the size
of the generated pack file by ensuring the exclusion of security-sensitive files and large binary files, while
preventing the leakage of confidential information.

Note: Binary files are not included in the packed output by default, but their paths are listed in the "Repository
Structure" section of the output file. This provides a complete overview of the repository structure while keeping the
packed file efficient and text-based.

### Custom Instruction

The `output.instructionFilePath` option allows you to specify a separate file containing detailed instructions or
context about your project. This allows AI systems to understand the specific context and requirements of your project,
potentially leading to more relevant and tailored analysis or suggestions.

Here's an example of how you might use this feature:

1. Create a file named `repomix-instruction.md` in your project root:

```markdown
# Coding Guidelines

- Follow the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide
- Suggest splitting files into smaller, focused units when appropriate
- Add comments for non-obvious logic. Keep all text in English
- All new features should have corresponding unit tests

# Generate Comprehensive Output

- Include all content without abbreviation, unless specified otherwise
- Optimize for handling large codebases while maintaining output quality
```

2. In your `repomix.config.json`, add the `instructionFilePath` option:

```json5
{
  "output": {
    "instructionFilePath": "repomix-instruction.md",
    // other options...
  }
}
```

When Repomix generates the output, it will include the contents of `repomix-instruction.md` in a dedicated section.

Note: The instruction content is appended at the end of the output file. This placement can be particularly effective
for AI systems. For those interested in understanding why this might be beneficial, Anthropic provides some insights in
their documentation:  
https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/long-context-tips

> Put long-form data at the top: Place your long documents and inputs (~20K+ tokens) near the top of your prompt, above
> your query, instructions, and examples. This can significantly improve Claude's performance across all models.
> Queries at the end can improve response quality by up to 30% in tests, especially with complex, multi-document inputs.

### Comment Removal

When `output.removeComments` is set to `true`, Repomix will attempt to remove comments from supported file types. This
feature can help reduce the size of the output file and focus on the essential code content.

Supported languages include:  
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue, Svelte, Python, PHP, Ruby, C, C#, Java, Go, Rust, Swift, Kotlin, Dart, Shell,
and YAML.

Note: The comment removal process is conservative to avoid accidentally removing code. In complex cases, some comments
might be retained.

## 🔍 Security Check

Repomix includes a security check feature that uses [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint) to detect
potentially sensitive information in your files. This feature helps you identify possible security risks before sharing
your packed repository.

The security check results will be displayed in the CLI output after the packing process is complete. If any suspicious
files are detected, you'll see a list of these files along with a warning message.

Example output:

```
🔍 Security Check:
──────────────────
2 suspicious file(s) detected:
1. src/utils/test.txt
2. tests/utils/secretLintUtils.test.ts

Please review these files for potentially sensitive information.
```

By default, Repomix's security check feature is enabled. You can disable it by setting `security.enableSecurityCheck` to
`false` in your configuration file:

```json
{
  "security": {
    "enableSecurityCheck": false
  }
}
```

Or using the `--no-security-check` command line option:

```bash
repomix --no-security-check
```

> [!NOTE]
> Disabling security checks may expose sensitive information. Use this option with caution and only when necessary, such
> as when working with test files or documentation that contains example credentials.

## 🤖 Using Repomix with GitHub Actions

You can also use Repomix in your GitHub Actions workflows. This is useful for automating the process of packing your codebase for AI analysis.

Basic usage:

  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    output: repomix-output.xml
    style: xml
```

Use `--style` to generate output in different formats:

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    output: repomix-output.md
    style: markdown
```

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix (JSON format)
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    output: repomix-output.json
    style: json
```

Pack specific directories with compression:

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    directories: src tests
    include: "**/*.ts,**/*.md"
    ignore: "**/*.test.ts"
    output: repomix-output.txt
    compress: true
```

Upload the output file as an artifact:

```yaml
- name: Pack repository with Repomix
  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main
  with:
    directories: src
    output: repomix-output.txt
    compress: true

- name: Upload Repomix output
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: repomix-output
    path: repomix-output.txt
```

## 📚 Using Repomix as a Library

In addition to using Repomix as a CLI tool, you can also use it as a library in your Node.js applications.

### Installation

```bash
npm install repomix
```

### Basic Usage

```javascript
import { runCli, type CliOptions } from 'repomix';

// Process current directory with custom options
async function packProject() {
  const options = {
    output: 'output.xml',
    style: 'xml',
    compress: true,
    quiet: true
  } as CliOptions;
  
  const result = await runCli(['.'], process.cwd(), options);
  return result.packResult;
}
```

### Process Remote Repository

```javascript
import { runCli, type CliOptions } from 'repomix';

// Clone and process a GitHub repo
async function processRemoteRepo(repoUrl) {
  const options = {
    remote: repoUrl,
    output: 'output.xml',
    compress: true
  } as CliOptions;
  
  return await runCli(['.'], process.cwd(), options);
}
```

### Using Core Components

If you need more control, you can use the low-level APIs:

```javascript
import { searchFiles, collectFiles, processFiles, TokenCounter } from 'repomix';

async function analyzeFiles(directory) {
  // Find and collect files
  const { filePaths } = await searchFiles(directory, { /* config */ });
  const rawFiles = await collectFiles(filePaths, directory);
  const processedFiles = await processFiles(rawFiles, { /* config */ });
  
  // Count tokens
  const tokenCounter = new TokenCounter('o200k_base');
  
  // Return analysis results
  return processedFiles.map(file => ({
    path: file.path,
    tokens: tokenCounter.countTokens(file.content)
  }));
}
```

For more examples, check the source code at [website/server/src/remoteRepo.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/....ts) which demonstrates how repomix.com uses the library.

# Repomix Project Structure and Overview

This document provides a structural overview of the Repomix project, designed to aid AI code assistants (like Copilot) in understanding the codebase.

Please refer to `README.md` for a complete and up-to-date project overview, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` for implementation guidelines and contribution procedures.

## Project Overview

Repomix is a tool that packs the contents of a software repository into a single file, making it easier for AI systems to analyze and process the codebase. It supports various output formats (plain text, XML, Markdown), ignores files based on configurable patterns, and performs security checks to exclude potentially sensitive information.

## Directory Structure

```

----------------------------------------------------------------

# Coding Guidelines
- Follow the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide.
- Split files into smaller, focused units when appropriate:
  - Aim to keep code files under 250 lines. If a file exceeds 250 lines, split it into multiple files based on functionality.
- Add comments to clarify non-obvious logic. **Ensure all comments are written in English.**
- Provide corresponding unit tests for all new features.
- After implementation, verify changes by running:
  ```bash
  npm run lint  # Ensure code style compliance
  npm run test  # Verify all tests pass
  ```

## Dependencies and Testing
- Inject dependencies through a deps object parameter for testability
- Example:
  ```typescript
  export const functionName = async (
    param1: Type1,
    param2: Type2,
    deps = {
      defaultFunction1,
      defaultFunction2,
    }
  ) => {
    // Use deps.defaultFunction1() instead of direct call
  };
  ```
- Mock dependencies by passing test doubles through deps object
- Use vi.mock() only when dependency injection is not feasible

## Generate Comprehensive Output
- Include all content without abbreviation, unless specified otherwise
- Optimize for handling large codebases while maintaining output quality

----------------------------------------------------------------

- Added new `parsableStyle` option for better output handling:
  - Ensures output strictly follows the specification of the chosen format
  - Provides properly escaped XML output with fast-xml-parser
  - Dynamically adjusts markdown code block delimiters to avoid content conflicts
- Available via CLI flag `--parsable-style` or in configuration file
